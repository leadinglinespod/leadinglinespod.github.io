When we started brainstorming ideas for a new educational technology podcast, we knew we wanted to include Vanderbilt instructors who use technology in innovative ways.  We talk to colleagues regularly who impress us, and we wanted to share their ideas and perspectives beyond our own campus. 

In this episode, we feature our first Vanderbilt guest, Corbette Doyle.  Corbette is a lecturer in organizational leadership in the Department of Leadership, Policy, and Organizations at Peabody College of Education and Human Development.  She came to Vanderbilt in 2008 after a successful career in the healthcare industry, where she focused on strategic planning, diversity in the workplace, and risk financing.  In her interview, she talks about the ways she uses technologies like Google Plus and Poll Everywhere in the service of very intentional teaching objectives, and she reflects on how she approaches adoption of new educational technologies.

 Derek Bruff: [00:09] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
 Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, director of the
 Vanderbilt Center for Teaching. In this podcast, we'll explore
 creative intentional and effective uses of technology to enhance
 student learning.

 [00:18] Uses that point a way to the future of educational
 technology in college and university settings. The podcast is produced
 at Vanderbilt by the Center for Teaching, the Vanderbilt Institute for
 Digital learning, the office of Scholarly Communications, and the
 Associate Provost for Digital Learning.

 [00:32] When my colleagues and I started brainstorming ideas for a
 new educational technology podcast, we knew we wanted to feature
 Vanderbilt instructors who use technology in innovative ways. We talk
 to colleagues regularly who impress us and we wanted to share their
 ideas and perspective beyond our single campus.

 [00:48] We didn't want the podcast to be all Vanderbilt all the time
 however, so we're bringing in a mix of guests. Some from Vanderbilt
 and some from elsewhere.

 [00:55] In this episode, we feature our first Vanderbilt guest,
 Corbette Doyle. Corbette is a lecturer in organizational leadership in
 the Department of Leadership Policy and Organizations here at
 Vanderbilt.

 [01:05] I met Corbette several years ago when she started teaching
 here after a very successful career on the private sector. She was
 eager to find ways technology could enhance her teaching back then and
 she continues to do so today.

 [01:16] I find that she's usually a couple of steps ahead of most
 faculty when it comes to educational technology. I'm particularly
 impressed with how intentional she is when it comes to adopting new
 technologies in her teaching. There's always a pedagogical purpose to
 her use of technology, and I think you'll hear that in her interview.

 [01:32] [music]

 Derek: [01:32] Corbette, thanks for speaking with me today.

 Corbette Doyle: [01:34] Pleasure.

 Derek: [01:35] Can you start by introducing yourself and telling us
 just a little bit about your background and what led you here to
 Vanderbilt?

 Corbette: [01:41] I'm a faculty of the Leadership Policy and
 Organizations Department on the Peabody campus. The focus of the
 courses that I teach are diversity, which is my passion, and strategy
 and analytics, teaching people how to use data to drive organizational
 strategies, all kinds of organizations.

 Derek: [02:06] What are some of the programs you teach in or the
 students that you work with?

 Corbette: [02:11] The primary program that I teach in is one of our
 master's track, and it is the Leadership and Organizational
 Performance track within Peabody. The focus is really on students who
 are seeking either leadership roles in education, in not-for-profits,
 or in start-ups, or people who are interested in pursuing a human
 capital career.

 [02:36] I also teach, as I mentioned, I tutor a master's level
 course in a global diversity. I also teach in an undergraduate class
 in analytics.

 Derek: [02:47] With that in context, what are some ways that you've
 used technology to enhance the face-to-face learning experience that
 your students have here at Vanderbilt?

 Corbette: [02:57] I use technology in all my courses and part of
 that is because I love technolog. I'm always exploring new technology.
 I hate to mention the year I acquired my first personal computer, it
 was 1981, that was early days for personal computer.

 [03:16] I've always loved technology and always push the envelope in
 terms of trying to understand how you can use technology. Same thing
 in a corporate career, I developed the first knowledge-based intranet
 for the organization, trying to capture knowledge in accessible format
 on a broad basis.

 [03:38] From a core standpoint, I'm naturally going to look for
 technology because I have my experience says technology enhances
 effort, and I'm always looking for ways to be more effective and
 efficient on a combined basis.

 [03:54] In the strategy and analytics courses, I have found
 technology particularly useful in two key ways. One, I'm a huge
 believer in problem-based learning because I believe people learn by
 doing, they don't learn by sitting and listening to someone talk the
 whole time.

 [04:20] Not that podcasts aren't useful and other methods of oral
 communication aren't useful, they're just not sufficient. I focus all
 of my classes on group projects and the students work through in order
 to solve the problem or create a project.

 [04:41] They work through the underlying issues identifying what
 they need to know, what they need to do. I have found a number of
 technology tools are critical for making that experiential learning
 effective. The simplest one, near and dear to your heart, is using
 polling.

 [05:06] One of the problems that you encounter as a faculty member
 when you are centering the learning around the student is that you
 don't necessarily know what they're learning because you're no longer
 giving them the content, they're discovering it on their own, and
 while you want that self-discovery, you also want to make sure people
 are on the right track.

 [05:28] I make extensive use of polling for formative learning
 purposes. Trying to identify where the majority is, I'll do a poll on
 a key concept based on where they are and the problem or project
 they're working on.

 [05:45] Depending upon the results...I do it anonymously, it's
 non-graded, no fear on the part of any of the students, and I'll see
 what the answer looks like, and then we'll talk through the different
 answers.

 [06:01] Having this opportunity for the students to see whatever
 they answered, it's unlikely that they were alone, they had company,
 we can talk through when a certain answer might be right, the
 misperceptions that might have led students to pick one answer.

 [06:19] That allows me to steer the classroom, to do spot learning,
 and just-in-time learning, and make sure that the class is moving
 together collectively on an appropriate path. That's critical, that
 use of technology, for that action oriented or experiential learning.

 Derek: [06:39] Let me ask you a quick follow-up on that. If you were
 to take the polling technology out of the classroom, and try to do
 that same kind of thing, what would what would be challenging about
 that, without the polling technology?

 Corbette: [06:49] The challenge without the polling is that...When
 I'm doing the group-based learning, I go around the room, and I sit
 with groups, and I listen. But you don't hear everyone talking, you
 don't know what everyone is thinking, and you can't, for every concept
 get to every group in the class.

 [07:11] It's impossible to get that insight that is critical to
 truly making sure that the vast majority of the class is grasping
 critical concepts and isn't going off in a wrong direction.

 [07:25] The other way that I use technology is, I now use a whole
 series of Screencasts. When you switch to this group-based learning,
 you have all this content you want to make sure they have access to,
 yes they have whatever reading materials you've assigned, but everyone
 has different learning styles.

 [07:46] Not everyone can learn content, particularly quantitative
 content they don't like by reading the book. I have taken lectures
 that I used to give on some of the critical concepts of accounting,
 finance, analytics, and use of Excel, and turned them into a series of
 Screencast.

 [08:07] I've created a YouTube channel for the class and they're all
 on the YouTube channel. I've had TAs create additional ones, some of
 the Excel workshops I've had some of my the TAs do. There's a whole
 series of YouTube videos and the students love it because...I set them
 up with questions, and then I pause, they have to try to think of the
 answer, and then it goes on.

 [08:35] They can watch some over and over again if they're
 struggling with a particular concept. They don't have to get it, it's
 not once and done, and students really appreciate that.

 Derek: [08:45] How directive are you with those videos? Do you say,
 "Before Wednesday's class, you need to watch these three videos," or
 is it more a general resource bank that students can access as a
 medium?

 Corbette: [08:55] It's a general resource bank, I encourage you to
 watch it. I do an upfront survey before the course starts to try to
 test the fear factor for analytics as well as the experience with some
 of the different concepts. I advise students up front, "Look, if your
 fear factor was five, you might want to watch these videos all before
 the first class."

 [09:22] What I have since gone to is recommending certain videos at
 certain points in the class. If you haven't watched these, or you
 might want to watch them again, these will be very useful at this
 point in the course.

 Derek: [09:34] One reason I ask is, you've heard about the
 flipped-classroom model, which is more directive. "Watch these videos
 and then come to class and we'll do these activities together."

 [09:44] But I think there's value in having some direction for
 students, because often they're not quite sure where to go with their
 questions. They're in the middle of a problem and they need access to
 some kind of content that's going to help them solve that, but
 navigating their way to the right kind of content can be tricky.

 Corbette: [10:00] At the right time.

 Derek: [10:01] Right. Giving them a little guidance, I think, it's
 often very helpful.

 Corbette: [10:04] Yes, I've also moved away from...I know a lot of
 faculty are very concerned that students might not be reading the
 assigned material. I've, for the most part, abandoned that. I still
 struggle, on occasion, but I've really come to the position that my
 goal is where students are at the end of the course.

 [10:29] If they can get there without reading some of the material
 that I've assigned, so be it. These are adults, they're young adults,
 but they are adults. I'm not going to test them to say, "Did you read
 this?" and ask [inaudible] questions. I just don't really care. I'm
 more focused on learning acquisition.

 Derek: [10:50] What does assessment look like in your courses? I'm
 guessing there's not a lot of tests.

 Corbette: [10:53] I do use one test. In the analytics classes, each
 of them, I have one test. It's at the three-quarter point in the
 course. All of my analytics classes, graduate and undergraduate, I
 bookend. Half the class is problem-based learning, the first quarter
 and the last quarter.

 [11:12] Then, in between, it's more traditional. I have homework in
 the middle. The way I do homework is...The group projects are
 group-based, all the students and I use Google forms.

 [11:26] I have the students complete a survey, they evaluate one
 another in the group, and they distribute 100 points among the whole
 group, and that forms an individual weight, and that's applied to the
 group grade. It might be more than one, it might be less than one.

 [11:40] But that's your grade, everybody knows that going in. That's
 a wonderful anonymous tool, it's amazing how much information students
 will give you on people in the group, good and bad.

 [11:52] Then for the homework, the way I do the homework is, you do
 it on your own. You can talk to people before you start it, but you
 have to do it on your own. You come in, they sit in groups, and they
 share their answers with one another.

 [12:05] They make notes on what they would have done differently,
 and they make notes on how they would have changed the answer, things
 they learn from other people that they thought were more useful.

 [12:17] Then I present a sample set of answers, because there's
 usually multiple ways to approach it. Then they self-grade based on
 their effort before they got to class, their contribution in the group
 discussion, and then I grade.

 [12:30] That's the grade they get on the homework. That's how I
 assess it. The one test is really case-based. I give them a situation
 from the news, and I come up with a series of questions that links to
 the course content. Again, there's rarely a right answer.

 [12:50] I'm more focused on how they dissected the issues, how they
 tried to understand what the pros and cons were, and then how they put
 their responses to the questions together. It will be a series of
 questions that's all laddering that course content as well as the
 solutions.

 Derek: [13:13] But very applied.

 Corbette: [13:14] All applied.

 Derek: [13:15] All applied. I'm curious, you mentioned the global
 diversity course that you teach. Have you found ways that technology
 works particularly well in that course, as opposed to the analytics
 courses?

 Corbette: [13:29] Yes. Again, I use a lot of group projects in that
 course, so there's a lot of group sharing of what they're all doing.
 One of the things I forgot to mention, in all of my classes, I use
 this, it's even more important in the diversity class, and it's a
 discussion form. I don't like our LMS discussion forms, so I use
 Google Plus.

 [13:50] I like Google Plus because it's so mobile-friendly.
 Everybody has Gmail, it's very visual, and I think the visual nature
 is far more appealing, students constantly share articles. I encourage
 in all of my classes, students to...

 [14:11] A heavy part of the participation grade is participating in
 Google Plus, because it's showing that they're thinking about the
 content beyond the classroom, and that they're applying it to the real
 world.

 [14:23] In the diversity class, it's a combination of voluntary, and
 there's...the last 12 months, the volume of information on diversity
 issues is massive. I was actually teaching the course when Ferguson
 happened, and we happened to have an African American divinity student
 from Ferguson in the class, and he was going home every weekend.

 [14:48] It's just so dynamic right now because of where the world
 is, and students are constantly sharing information that they're
 coming across with one another.

 [15:01] There's also assigned content, so the students all do a
 group lecture. They pick a topic of interest to them, and then they
 teach the course.

 [15:10] They learn about it, then they teach the class. They all
 have to post assigned readings on Google Plus for the rest of the
 class before they teach, and they all have to do a lit review table,
 and they all have to pick one article from their lit review and share
 the summary of that on Google Plus.

 [15:30] It creates a forum for sharing what each person is learning
 outside of the classroom and in a dynamic arena, like diversity, and
 inclusion. It becomes such a robust vehicle for continuing the
 dialogue, and allowing people to express their thoughts, and again,
 amplify the learning.

 [15:59] I'm willing to take risks because I like technology, and I'm
 pretty adept at figuring it out. People who don't love technology
 struggle to figure it out on their own.

 [16:11] A lot of students, it continues to amaze me...my own
 children, I have two daughters, they're both in their early 20s,
 neither one are tech-savvy, despite what everyone says about
 millennials. They come to me with all of their tech questions,
 including for their phones.

 [16:31] I find a lot of students are not as tech-savvy as the media
 would have you believe, so it's important to keep technology simple
 for students, not just for faculty.

 Derek: [16:46] You've touched on a couple of thoughts on this next
 question already, but when you consider experimenting with, or
 adopting a new educational technology, what are some principles you
 keep in mind?

 Corbette: [16:57] A key one I haven't mentioned is student reaction
 to having to go to multiple sites for course content or course
 activities. This is a frustration for me, because I like robust,
 easy-to-use technology.

 [17:22] No offense to anyone, but Blackboard is robust, but it is
 not simple to use, and it's not attractive, it's not user-friendly,
 and it doesn't meet a lot of my needs, in terms of what I'm looking
 for in a technology platform. But that is the vehicle where all
 copyright-protected information needs to be provided.

 [17:49] I am trying to minimize my use of textbooks for a host of
 reasons. One is costs for the students. I just object to the idea of
 asking students to pay a fortune for the textbook, so I won't use
 extremely expensive textbooks. There's other sources, you might have
 to look harder to find them.

 [18:12] I'm able to find a lot of publicly available sources for
 content that I want to use, but a lot of content that I want to use,
 particularly for my diversity course is copyright-protected material,
 so it has to be on Blackboard, so I have to use Blackboard for that. I
 have to use Blackboard for anything with grades and submission of
 content.

 [18:38] That's my struggle. Whenever I'm looking at technology, I'm
 always looking at how minimizing the number of sources. It's why I've
 resorted to Google, because I can get so much on the Google platform
 and it's only one other place I have to send students, and they can
 get everything else.

 [18:59] They can get the Google docs, they can get the Google forms
 with the surveys that I ask them to complete on one another or for the
 class. They can use it for hangout, for conversations, and I can use
 it for discussion form.

 [19:13] That's the key thing that I look at when I evaluate an
 alternative technology use, "Am I going to get push back from the
 students by sending them to one more place?"

 Derek: [19:27] I get that because I find that in my courses too,
 that I want to use social bookmarking tool over here, maybe Twitter
 over here. I use WordPress for lot of my activities. I try to run as
 much as I can through my own blog, but yeah, they still need to go to
 Blackboard for some things too.

 [19:44] There is this kind of calculus you do where you think, "OK,
 here's a tool that would add a lot, but does it add enough to the
 experience to outweigh the negatives of having yet one more place
 students have to track of."

 Corbette: [19:58] Right. Then, what I do to try and compensate for
 that is make sure I have links for everything everywhere. If they want
 to go to Blackboard, I have links for everything we're doing on Google
 on Blackboard.

 Derek: [20:10] I know students. I've heard many students say too,
 they like the kind of one-stop shop. They really like to know where
 all things go. Occasionally, I even imagine what if a student of mine
 has four other instructors who were taking the approach I'm doing.
 Now, the problem is magnified by five courses, right?

 Corbette: [20:29] Correct, right, and I haven't even thought about
 that but that's a great point.

 Derek: [20:33] Let's look ahead for a minute. If you can imagine the
 next three or four years, I tend not to think too much further beyond
 that, it's hard to make predictions.

 [20:43] I am not actually asking you to predict, but as you think
 about where you would like to see educational technology go, either in
 terms of its [inaudible] and what it can do, or ways that you'd like
 to use in your own teaching, or just changes to the landscape you'd
 like to see, looking ahead, what would you like to see happen in the
 world of educational technology over the next few years?

 Corbette: [21:05] The solution to the problem I just identified, a
 very robust, secure digital platform that allowed me to integrate all
 the kind of tools I want to use, which probably means it has to be a
 flexible platform, because those needs and the tools are going to
 change, that is highly mobile-friendly. That would ...

 Derek: [21:35] Why is that so important?

 Corbette: [21:36] Because so many students are using their phones
 the majority of the time, that's going to increase. Because I put such
 a heavy emphasis on digital dialog outside of the class, when you see
 something that relates to the course learning, I want you to say, "Oh,
 wow! Let me share that."

 [22:05] I want you to be able to do it where you are and most
 students are getting their news from their phones, and so I want an
 easy way for them to quickly share that, right at the moment,
 otherwise it won't happen. It doesn't happen to me. I mean I'm
 constantly seeing things, "Oh! I want to share that with my class." If
 I don't have an easy way to do that, I tend not to share it.

 Derek: [22:28] Yeah. I'll do this thing where I email myself a
 link...

 Corbette: [22:31] That's what I do.

 Derek: [22:33] so that when I'm back in the office, I can post it
 somewhere, but that's awkward, right?

 Corbette: [22:36] That's exactly what I do and I get very frustrated
 because sometimes I have a long list of to-do links because now I have
 to go do one more thing. I want to be able to share it right then and
 there as well.

 Derek: [22:47] We have a question we ask all our guests and it's a
 little weird, but I'm curious to know how you'll answer it. What's
 your favorite analog educational technology?

 Corbette: [22:58] You know, I think I'm going to borrow from one of
 my favorite technology gurus namely, you, and say that it is a
 flexible classroom situation, because I rely upon group works so
 heavily in all of my courses. I have to have a classroom setting that
 facilitates the formation of groups and the easy formation of groups.

 [23:24] That means tables and movable chairs, and fortunately, I
 teach on the Peabody campus and all of our classrooms, at least all
 the ones I teach in, we do have one auditorium, but I don't teach in
 the auditorium. All of our classrooms have movable tables and chairs.

 [23:44] We can constantly shift the physical structure of the
 classroom to meet those needs and I generally only have students
 sitting in groups and it just makes it easier.

 Derek: [23:55] You're preaching at the choir here, but for the sake
 of our listeners, what makes a fixed-sitting lecture hall challenging
 for you to teach in?

 Corbette: [24:07] The problem is that if it's a true lecture hall,
 the floor is slanted, so it makes it very difficult. Your chairs might
 swivel around, so what you're forced to do, I occasionally have given
 presentations at [inaudible] . Our business school, most of the
 classrooms are structured with fixed tables and fixed chairs that
 swivel.

 [24:33] But it's a more awkward arrangement because the floors are
 slanted and it isn't as congenial as being able to literally pull your
 chairs up to a table and all be on the same level. It's doable if
 you're in a room with fixed chairs that swivel. If you're in a room
 with fixed chairs that don't swivel, on a 360-basis, you can't do it.
 I don't know what you would do.

 Derek: [25:01] I find that you can often have students turn to their
 neighbor, right? You can have pair work.

 Corbette: [25:07] Pair work. I don't do much pair work.

 Derek: [25:09] But beyond pair work, if you have groups of size
 three, four, five, or six, I find that you need some furniture that
 supports that.

 Corbette: [25:15] I do groups of three to six.

 Derek: [25:18] All right. Well, thank you Corbette. This has been a
 lot of fun.

 Corbette: [25:21] It was a treat. Thank you.

 Derek: [25:23] Thanks for being in the podcast.

 Corbette: [25:26] Thank you. All right.

 Derek: [25:27] That was Corbette Doyle, lecturer in organizational
 leadership here at Vanderbilt University. You can find Corbette's
