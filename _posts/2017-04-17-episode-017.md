In this episode, we speak with LaTonya Trotter, assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University.  Trotter is a medical sociologist, using ethnographic approaches to study how changes in the medical workplace alter how we think about illness and medical care.  She was also a Junior Faculty Teaching Fellow at the Vanderbilt Center for Teaching, and she thoughtfully selects technologies for use in her teaching that align with the goals she has for her students learning.
