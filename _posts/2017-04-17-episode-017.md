In this episode, we speak with LaTonya Trotter, assistant professor of sociology at Vanderbilt University.  Trotter is a medical sociologist, using ethnographic approaches to study how changes in the medical workplace alter how we think about illness and medical care.  She was also a Junior Faculty Teaching Fellow at the Vanderbilt Center for Teaching, and she thoughtfully selects technologies for use in her teaching that align with the goals she has for her students learning.

## Episode 17: LaTonya Trotter

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:07] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, Director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching.

[00:11] In this podcast, we explore creative, intentional, and
effective uses of technology to enhance student learning, uses that
point the way that the future of educational technology in college and
university settings.

[00:21] In this episode, I speak with LaTonya Trotter, Assistant
Professor of Sociology here at Vanderbilt. LaTonya is a medical
sociologist, using ethnographic approaches to study how changes in the
medical workplace alter how we think about illness and medical care.

[00:33] I met LaTonya last year when she was a participant in our
Junior Faculty Teaching Fellows Program. She had a lot of interest in
educational technology. As I got to know her, I found her to be very
thoughtful about her use of technology.

[00:46] As you'll hear in the interview, LaTonya selectively uses
technology in ways closely aligned with her teaching and learning goals.

[00:51] [music]

**Derek**:  [00:51] Welcome LaTonya to "Leading Lines." I'm excited to
talk with you today.

**LaTonya Trotter**:  [01:00] Thank you for having me.

**Derek**:  [01:02] Can you start by telling us a little bit about who
you are and what you do here at Vanderbilt?

**LaTonya**:  [01:07] I'm a professor in the sociology department. I
look at the intersection of sociology of medicine and social inequality.
Really looking at how changes in how we organize medical work affect the
reproduction of economic inequality and racial inequality.

**Derek**:  [01:35] What kind of courses do you teach here?

**LaTonya**:  [01:37] I teach pretty much every semester my primary
courses. I teach a course called society and medicine, which is
essentially an introduction to the sociology of medicine.

[01:52] Taking students through thinking about the kinds of things
that happen in healthcare, healthcare delivery, thinking about advances
in medical knowledge and the ways in which those things are related to
broader trends in social life.

**Derek**:  [02:08] Can you give me an example of that? What's
[inaudible] or an example of that?

**LaTonya**:  [02:13] One of the books that I always read in that
class is a book by Elizabeth Armstrong. She really looks at the social
construction of fetal alcohol syndrome.

[02:24] One of the reasons why I enjoy reading that book is because
fetal alcohol syndrome is not a contested medical condition, right?
Within healthcare, everyone believes that they know that, that is an
actual syndrome related to mothers drinking alcohol while they're
pregnant.

[02:46] Reading this book really takes them through a period of time
in which we didn't have that kind of diagnosis. What are the kind of
things that happen between not having that diagnosis and having that
diagnosis?

[03:00] Looking at the ways in which we think of physicians and folks
who're involved in clinical research as having these very set ways in
which they go through research and peer review is a process that is
always highly rigorous, but clinicians and researchers are human beings.

[03:23] [crosstalk]

**LaTonya**:  [03:24] So, they often draw from things that are going
on in the broader terrain. There were transformations happening in the
way in which we thought about alcohol as being a wonderful social
lubricant to having it be transformed into a social ill that we related
to the construction of the fetal alcohol syndrome.

[03:46] It's a really interesting book because it challenges students
to think about the relationship between broader trends going on in the
social world and medical knowledge in a way that they hadn't thought of
before.

**Derek**:  [04:02] Do you have a lot of pre‑med students in that type
of course?

**LaTonya**:  [04:06] I have a lot of pre‑med students and a lot of
pre‑nursing students.

**Derek**:  [04:09] They're planning to go into a career, profession,
where perhaps having this other way of looking at how knowledge is
constructed and how their work is constructed could be really useful.

**LaTonya**:  [04:23] Yes.

**Derek**:  [04:24] Let's talk a little bit about how you use
technology in that kind of class setting. What are some ways that you
found to use technology either effectively or maybe some experiments
that didn't quite work out?

**LaTonya**:  [04:36] I started out this conversation by talking about
one of the books to be read. There's ways in which I'm a traditionalist.

[04:42] Primarily I organize my courses around the reading of books,
which actually still has a role to play. I write books. I hope people
are reading them, but also just for students. There is something really
quite valuable in long‑form reading and spending time with a topic.

[05:09] I also want my students not just to spend time in class taking
in information that other people have read, but also producing some
things that they share with other people, that they share with me. One
of the pieces of technology that I use in my classroom is really the use
of the classroom blog.

[05:32] Where, I ask students, 7 to 10 times depending on the course,
to write about what are the things that they have gotten from the
reading.

[05:43] The connections that they might make between the reading, and
issues going on in the world. Contemporary issues or making connections
to other books that we've read over the course of the semester.

[05:56] The reason why I like to use the blog is because it's public
within the classroom because in another course that I teach called
Medical Controversies, which is writing a tenth of course.

[06:13] One of the conundrums that I had to work through was that
students are so used to writing for a teacher.

[06:21] They write content to give to someone who gives them an
evaluation and they get that evaluation back so the experience writing
is being a private form of communication as opposed to thinking about it
as a public communication, which in that course, we are really focused
on writing.

[06:39] I really want them to think about developing their voice for a
larger audience than just some authority figure who's going to give them
a grade on the thing that they write.

[06:49] For the blog, I thought, "Well, they could just write memos on
pieces of paper and give them to me, but it still sets up that same
dynamic, which is that they are trying to please me."

[07:00] I'm their only audience and the reason why I'm reading it is
because I'm giving them a grade and so for the last couple of years,
I've been using blogs in my classroom setting. Which is partly it's a
way to just get students to write and think about the content but I
think there's something really powerful about them sharing their idea of
a larger audience.

[07:22] In class discussion, they will often say. They'll often begin
their comments by saying, "In my blog post, I wrote," and other people
in the class will say, "While I was reading so and so blog post then I
think that..."

[07:35] It really gives them a sense that it gives them a concrete
feeling that they're participating in the conversation. They're not just
writing something because I told them they had to write it, but that
their writing has value outside of the grading relationship between me
and them.

**Derek**:  [07:55] You mentioned a couple of examples of this
already, but are there other ways in which you take what they do outside
of class in the blog and build that into the class discussions or vice
versa?

[08:05] I find it sometimes if the in‑class and out of class are
disassociated, then the out of class activities starts to feel busy work
and were not very useful so I'm wondering, are there other strategies
you use to complete that loop?

**LaTonya**:  [08:17] One of the things is just timing. The blog posts
are due before class discussion.

[08:24] They're due six or seven hours before we meet for class so it
gives other students an opportunity to read the blog post when they come
to class, but it also gives me an opportunity to read the blog post
before I come to class and to use them as a springboard for shaping the
discussion.

[08:46] Drawing people into the discussion. If I know that there are
students who've written, brought up really interesting things in their
blog post, then I can use that as a platform for beginning discussion.
That's sometimes helpful too. One of the other things that you try to
get students to do is participate in course discussion.

[09:07] Students have varying levels of comfortability with doing that
so if I know that they have already thought about something, it's not a
deer in headlights, putting them on the spot.

[09:17] But I'm actually able to engage them in something that they
have thought about. Then, it also gives me a way of engaging them more
thoughtfully in the classroom discussion without feeling that they're
being put on the spot.

**Derek**:  [09:30] There's still this piece where you are the reader.
You are but they also had each other as readers.

[09:40] I would agree that tends to be powerful. It feels more
authentic often for students because they're not just doing this thing
that you made up for them. They have their peers as an audience. Is your
blog close to the course?

**LaTonya**:  [09:54] It is close to the course.

**Derek**:  [09:55] OK, so not public.

**LaTonya**:  [09:56] It's not public.

**Derek**:  [09:57] What's your thought on that choice because I can
imagine situations where you might want to make it public but you've
chosen not to?

**LaTonya**:  [10:05] I have chosen not to and it's partly just
thinking about what it is that I want the blog to be about. One of the
other reasons why I want students to write about the reading in process
is really the sense that you can use writing as a way of thinking.

[10:33] It's not just about the polish thing at the end, but you can
use writing as a way of thinking. I don't necessarily want to make the
blog this thing that makes them focus more on the presentation and less
about the ideas.

[10:54] I really want it to be a space where they bring up issues,
where they ask questions, where they think through things for maybe
after we've come to class discussion they'll come out of class having a
different way of understanding the ideas.

[11:11] When I thought about what my pedagogical reasons were for
having the blog, and what it was that I wanted it to do. I thought it's
not, I want it to be a reasonably well written piece of writing, but I
don't want to be a polished piece of writing.

[11:31] I think that that was the choice that I had made. I'm building
towards thinking now about having a blog where finished assignments are
posted to a public blog.

[11:50] That's something that I'm building towards because I'm always
trying to close this loop between thinking of the classroom as a pretend
space, and thinking of the classroom as a real space.

[12:04] There are times when it's important to have pretend spaces, to
have practice space, to have places where you try things out.

[12:13] But you reference the idea of busy work, I also want them to
sort of think about, "Well, what are the connections between the kind of
things we're practicing in class. And how might we actually sort of take
these things that we've practiced and perfect them, and then put them
out into the world?"

[12:31] I haven't quite gotten there yet, but that is something that
I'm moving towards.

**Derek**:  [12:39] One of our earlier episodes we talked with Zolia
LeBron, from our history department here. She talked about a time when
she had students tweet in a course in the Arab Spring.

[12:51] One of her student's tweets had a hash tag, and it got picked
up and retweeted a lot in Islamist circles.

[12:59] There were a lot of interesting pieces to that, but I think
one thing that came out of that was it helped her students see a
connection between the practice conversations they were having in this
course, and actual communities out there right?

[13:11] When I think of writing, you're writing for an audience
typically. Having some public work, particularly if you have a community
in mind that you'd like your students to join in some fashion. Then that
I think can be a useful context in which to have them do something in
public. Are there other technologies that you've experimented with?

**LaTonya**:  [13:40] I've been thinking about using pod‑casting.
Having students create podcasts because it's a part of it is, me
thinking about what my students might want.

[13:53] But, then also me thinking about how can I challenge myself to
better create spaces where students can do a wider variety of things.
Because again I started out this commission by framing myself as being
the traditionalist where we read books and writes papers.

[14:10] Then I thought, "Well, for many of my students I think that
learning to write a paper is really very useful. But, I also think that
they're moving into a world where they are being asked to use a broader
set of media to be able to persuade people of things, to be able to
produce content that communicate certain kind of things."

[14:36] Me really thinking about, "Well, how can I match my
pedagogical commitments," which really are about long form, and really
are about people spending time in creating and crafting some things as
opposed to something like short things, or sometimes I think there can
be a way of using technologies in ways that are cute or ways that are
fun.

[15:04] Which you know who doesn't like fun, right? Everybody likes
fun, but then thinking about the ways in which you can sort of push
technology to do something other than something that is short and simply
pleasurable, but that also does similar things to long form writing.

[15:23] In my classroom I've experimented just in terms of my content,
and having them listen to podcasts to augment the things that we do in
class.

[15:34] I made a particular decision to use pod‑casting as opposed to
having them watch videos or films or something like that in class. Part
because I think oral communication is still telling stories in a way
that doesn't overwhelm the senses. Then still allow space I think for
well, certainly film allows space for cognitive work.

[15:59] I think it's harder. Sometimes when I've had students watch
clips, video there's ways in which they sort of sit back and watch in a
different kind of way than when they're listening to something.

**Derek**:  [16:12] Well, I think there's something about reading or
listening where you're getting one stream of information coming at you,
and you have to kind of make sense of it as you go, and you have to fill
in a lot.

[16:28] I think sometimes when you're watching film or video there's
so much coming out of us that we don't have to necessarily fill in the
gaps or connect the dots in the same way.

[16:41] Listening to a podcast is a little closer to reading a long
form piece of text in that it requires a similar kind of attention I
think in some ways.

[16:51] The podcast you have your students listen to, are these ones
that you create or you're finding things that are relevant and
interesting?

**LaTonya**:  [17:00] Yeah, I find things that are relevant and
interesting. I rely very heavily on this American life because it often
deals with contemporary issues that my students are reading about.

[17:13] It sort of gives them a way of having another narrative,
another story that looks at the similar issue that they might have been
reading about.

**Derek**:  [17:25] When you have them because I've actually played
with this a little bit because I'm a big fan of podcast. I have a 45
minute commute so I listen to a lot of podcast every week.

[17:34] I've started to use them a little bit with my own students
most, well in fact my statistics course and my writing course.

[17:40] I haven't quite figured out how to build them yet. If you give
your students a podcast assignment versus a more traditional reading
assignment, do you ask the same kinds of things of them? Do you ask
different questions?

**LaTonya**:  [17:57] I ask the same questions of them. The books to
we tend to read in my courses tend to be ethnography so either from an
anthropological tradition or sociological tradition where a scholar is
spending time in a particular area, a social life and essentially
collecting stories and watching behavior, right?

**Derek**:  [18:24] Yeah.

**LaTonya**:  [18:24] There are ways in which it matches onto a
similar storytelling that happens.

**Derek**:  [18:29] Not all podcast, but that kind of this American
life genre podcast.

**LaTonya**:  [18:34] It's very similar in terms of situating
individual stories within a larger context.

**Derek**:  [18:43] That's interesting because I think in my courses,
my other readings aren't like that. They were math textbooks so I can
see why I need to think more about it the kinds of questions you might
ask your students about the reading or about the podcast.

[19:00] You mentioned pulling your own content online publicly. Can
you say a little bit more about that and what do you share publicly and
why do you do that?

**LaTonya**:  [19:08] I share my course content. I share syllabi. I
share assignments online and partly, it's interesting to think about and
all these universities all over the US, all over the world. You have
people developing content that they treat as semi‑private information.

**Derek**:  [19:33] That's why I asked. There are faculty who would
never share a syllabus publicly, right? They might not even share it
with college down the hall.

**LaTonya**:  [19:43] Yeah. I think that there's something really
important and valuable about being able to share content with people and
I often have, when I talk with friends and colleagues and they ask me
about assignments, I go, "Well, here's a link to my website. You can go
look at it."

"[19:59] Just see what the wording is it that I use and we can talk
about it if you're interested why I did it at a certain way," and the
other was just too practically speaking, "Have you ever been in your
office and you're wanting to know something? Do you go look for a piece
of paper?" Do you go online?

[20:19] I would always have these moments when it's a classic
professors lament. Students are asking you a million questions that are
on the syllabus and you're just like, "You know that the answer to that
is on the syllabus." I thought to myself, "OK, well."

[20:33] One way of hearing or seeing that problem and to say, "Oh, I
just have this crazy, lazy student who just wouldn't read the syllabus,"
and I thought, "Well, it may be that the problem is me."

[20:44] It may be that I'm giving my students' information that's
really important for them to know in a way that is unnecessarily
difficult for them to access.

[20:51] I know that for myself, I will Google things before I will
look through a file to find the piece of paper.

[20:59] If it's online and publicly online, that's a SCAG and a
Blackboard universe where they have to log in that part of the logic is
to make the syllabus a living, breathing part of the class.

[21:13] It also means that if there's something I want to correct,
there's something I want to add. I can actually update it in real time
instead of students whipping out their piece of paper and writing the
chain and the date of something and pen.

**Derek**:  [21:26] Why not Blackboard or Course Management System?

**LaTonya**:  [21:32] I'm not sure I have the best answer to that
question except for myself. Having to go through an extra layer of
logging in makes me not want to do something.

**Derek**:  [21:51] Sure.

**LaTonya**:  [21:52] It just makes me not want to do it and it's not
the way that I organize the rest of anything else I do.

[21:58] We use information these days in a way in which it is freely
and easily available. Google. Sometimes you forget how amazing Google
is. You can put in, what is it? Plain language when you basically just
ask and get a question in whatever language you want.

**Derek**:  [22:17] Right. Not even search terms, but you just ask the
question for your exact question and it will interpolate.

**LaTonya**:  [22:21] Which part of what it does that make things easy
to find but also it takes away all the barriers that we use to have to
inform.

[22:30] I think that my students, I sometimes imagine that my students
are very much like me. If I have to go log into a system to find
information out, I might not do it, especially if I can just ask the
person standing in the front of the classroom.

**Derek**:  [22:45] Are there technologies that you've decided aren't
a good fit for your courses?

**LaTonya**:  [22:53] I think that there are technologies that have a
lot more immediacy to them like tweeting, which full disclosure.

[23:03] I don't really tweet or use Twitter so it may just be that I'm
less comfortable with those things. But when I think about what it is I
don't mostly do in class. I think there's number ways of making by
technology.

[23:16] Sometimes you want to meet students where they are and so if
they're using technology in a particular way, you want to, as best as
you can, enter into that world. But there are other times where I think
that there's some value in getting students to do the thing that they're
not doing in their world.

[23:36] It's one of the reasons why I still cling to books. It's one
of the reasons why in my classroom ‑‑ This is a podcast about
technology, but I ban technology from my classes.

**Derek**:  [23:47] I was wondering about that.

**LaTonya**:  [23:47] Part because I think that one of the things that
technology does is it allows people to be multiple places and I really
want my students to be in my class when they're in my class.

[24:02] Even when my class is boring and even when they would rather
distract themselves by being in some alternate space, we're going to sit
in this class for however long the class is and be here in that
particular moment and so I have decided against technologies that are
short and immediate.

[24:25] I sometimes have students who raise her hand and say, "I have
a question. Can I get on my laptop and look up the answer to the
question right now?"

[24:35] I say, "No. You can look it up outside of class though, and
really think about it. Think about what are the best places to get the
answer to this question."

[24:44] How do I think about the hits to the answer to this question
that I get and how do I make sense of this in a way that makes sense?

[24:56] There's immediacy I think is something that students are
really used to. This idea that you want to find something out, you just
go look at that right now.

**Derek**:  [25:06] Right and you have an answer right away.

**LaTonya**:  [25:09] Right away. If you want to communicate
something, you communicate it right away. I purposely want to create a
space in my class where I'm asking them to do something different than
that.

**Derek**:  [25:24] It sounds like it connects to your goals about
engaging students and long‑form thinking, long‑form reading that you're
not asking questions that have short answers.

[25:33] You're asking questions that have complicated answers that
require some intense thought and researching and time to work through
that.

[25:42] That makes a lot of sense. Also, the other piece about the
class is learning community. You want them to be present for each other
and so that's part of shaping that classroom environment.

[25:56] I'm going to end with the question we ask all of our guests on
this podcast. We talked mostly on this podcast about digital educational
technology. What's one of your favorite analog educational technologies?

**LaTonya**:  [26:13] I really believe very strongly in using books,
particularly books that are about human experience for students.

[26:23] Even from a scholarly perspective, I really foreground books
that in some ways, shape, or forms deal directly with human experience
as a way of getting students to think about world so they, themselves,
have an experience.

[26:39] Even to think about worlds that they have experienced, but to
see it from a different perspective. That transformative power of
reading is something that's probably my favorite and then writing so
getting students to go into the process of producing their own texts to
allow their readers to see something from a different perspective.

[27:10] I often tell students that they're something. Writing is like
magic. You create a world for people through using scribbling on a
screen or pieces of paper. It's really quite extraordinary if you think
about it.

**Derek**:  [27:29] Well, I've enjoyed this conversation thinking
about what you described just somewhat artificial two‑way relationship
between the student and the instructor. But, then broadening that to a
whole class and fostering multi‑point conversations and then, maybe
bringing in people who aren't physically there in the classroom.

[27:51] The folks who are reading and connecting with bigger
communities and all of it about making those connections and helping
other people see what's in your head and see what's in their head.
Thanks. This has been fun.

**LaTonya**:  [28:04] You're welcome. It's a pleasure.

[28:06] [music]

**Derek**:  [28:06] That was LaTonya Trotter, assistant professor of
sociology here at Vanderbilt University.

[28:12] I appreciated how LaTonya has a clear objective, helping
students with long‑form reading and selects technologies and teaching
practices that support that objective and I really liked her use Course
Blogs as a way to prepare students for deeper interactions during class.

[28:24] We talked with the number of faculty here at Vanderbilt and
elsewhere that have found Course Blogs are useful tool for learning and
engagement. I use them regularly in my first writing seminar.

[28:32] In this episode, I'll put a link to my Center for Teaching
Guide on Blogs, which features practical examples of instructors
teaching with blogs and a few video interviews with faculty here at
Vanderbilt who have used blogs successfully.
