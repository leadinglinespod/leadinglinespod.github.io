In this episode, we feature an interview with Mike Sharples of the Open University in the United Kingdom.  The Open University is a public research university committed to increasing access to college through open admissions and online learning.  It’s been around for more than 40 years, and it currently has more than 250,000 enrolled students from the UK and beyond.  The Open University also runs FutureLearn, a venture that offers free online courses to the world.  Not only does Mike Sharples hold a chair in educational technology at the Open University, but he is also the Academic Lead at FutureLearn.  In his interview, he draws on that experience to describe the kind of social, collaborative learning that can happen online when you have hundreds or even thousands of learners.

Sharples is interviewed by Gayathri Narasimham, Associate Director at the Vanderbilt Institute for Digital Learning, also known as VIDL.  VIDL is, among many other things, Vanderbilt’s production shop for massive open online courses (MOOCs), which is why Gayathri was interested in talking with Mike Sharples about his experience designing and assessing MOOCs.

 Derek Bruff: [00:01] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
 Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, director of the
 Vanderbilt Center for Teaching. In this podcast, we explore creative,
 intentional and effective uses of technology to enhance student
 learning. Uses that point the way to the future of educational
 technology in college and university settings.

 [00:24] In this episode, we feature an interview with Mike Sharples
 of the Open University in the United Kingdom. The Open University is a
 public research university committed to increasing access to college
 through open admissions and online learning. It's been around for more
 than 40 years and it currently has more than 250,000 enrolled students
 from the UK and beyond.

 [00:45] You may a few years ago that Massive Open Online Courses or
 MOOCs were getting a lot of attention in the states. I remember that
 our colleagues in the UK liked to point out, at the time, that open
 online courses weren't a novelty.

 [00:59] Indeed, The Open University had been offering them for
 years. That said, they too got into the MOOC business, setting up a
 venture called FutureLearn, offering free online courses to the world.

 [01:11] Not only does Mike Sharples hold the Chair in Educational
 Technology at The Open University but he is also the Academic Lead of
 FutureLearn. In his interview he draws on that experience to describe
 the kind of social, collaborative learning that can happen online when
 you have hundreds or even thousands of learners. Sharples is
 interviewed by Gayathri Narasimham, Associate Director at the
 Vanderbilt Institute for Digital Learning, also known as VIDL.

 [01:38] VIDL is among many other things, Vanderbilt's MOOC
 production shop, which is why Gayathri was interested in talking with
 Mike Sharples about his experience, designing and accessing Massive
 Open Online Courses.

 [01:49] One of the exciting aspects of producing this podcast across
 several units of Vanderbilt, including VIDL, is that we get to cast a
 wide net for interview subjects. There are half a dozen of us
 conducting interviews and we have a variety of interests in the field
 of educational technology. Gayathri met up with Sharples at a
 conference this summer and I found their conversation fascinating and
 encouraging. I hope you do too.

 [02:10] [background music]

 Gayathri Narasimham: [02:13] Hello, Professor Sharples. It's great
 that you can talk to me today for the Educational Technology Podcast.
 To begin with, what were your motivations to explore online learning,
 from your background in cognition, computer science and artificial
 intelligence, where did you see the lack in learning and education.

 Mike Sharples: [02:33] As an undergraduate, I did my final project
 around developing a computer language for young people, and I became
 fascinated by how technology could work to support education, not just
 acting as a teacher, but enabling people to come together, to learn
 together.

 [02:56] Now we have the opportunity, not just for people to learn
 together in a small area, but to do it at massive scale. For people
 all around the world with different views, different perspectives, to
 be able to share those, and for the technology to act as a way of
 supporting that, not replacing a teacher, but adding to the experience
 of learning, and that's what really fascinated me.

 Gayathri: [03:21] I'm fascinated that you emphasize social learning
 and online education. Can you tell us a bit about how you came to
 practically realize this, that is particularly scaling social learning
 to large groups of learners?

 Mike: [03:35] We know from more than 30 years of research that
 people learn best when they learn together. When you have an idea and
 you are sharing it with somebody else, and you are learning their
 perspective. Then as you get more people round the table, the
 opportunity to try and reach a consensus, or at least find out about
 people's different views.

 [03:59] That could be in some broad subject, in social sciences, or
 politics, or it could be in some more focused area like engineering
 where you may have a number of different right answers and you try to
 come to some consensus answer. We know that people learn better when
 they learn together.

 [04:17] What we didn't know, was whether you can really scale that
 up to not just ten people, or a hundred, but thousands of people, and
 so we've been looking at ways to design computer platforms that allow
 hundreds of thousands or millions of people to learn in that social
 way.

 [04:38] We had to look at a new theory of learning. We've been
 exploring at The Open University, a theory of learning based on
 learning as conversation, the idea that all learning is a
 conversation. We converse with ourselves as we come to understand and
 reflect on our own learning, and we converse with other people as
 well, we share our perspectives and try to reach agreements.

 [05:03] Then if you can put that onto technology, onto an online
 learning platform where people can, not just post their views, but can
 then have active discussions, and where you can bring in educators and
 instructors as supporters of those conversations, then you got
 something really powerful.

 [05:24] We still didn't know whether it would scale up to hundreds
 of thousands of people, so we've been trying it out on a platform, on
 a Massive Open Online Course platform called FutureLearn and we found
 that it works. It really does work.

 [05:37] On one course we had 270,000 people just on one course. Just
 one of those videos in the course there were 55,000 people discussing
 that video and sharing their ideas. We had a problem, which was, if
 you've got that richness in conversation, how do you manage it?

 [05:57] We had to bring in techniques from social networks of liking
 and following and profiles and so on, the sort of things that happen
 on Twitter, on Facebook and bring those into learning. We've now
 managed to develop an approach that support conversation for learning,
 and rich, productive conversations but also manages it using social
 network techniques. That's very exciting.

 Gayathri: [06:25] Given your concepts about learning as
 conversation, how do you see the role of technology in blended
 classrooms?

 Mike: [06:33] I think that's the next exciting area, which is to not
 to only have online learning but to blend that with campus learning,
 with learning in the home, learning in museums, how you can blend
 these different forms of learning together so that they appear
 seamless.

 [06:52] You might, for example, have a free open course with
 thousands of people taking part, which then leads into a campus course
 or people learning online working with people on the campus. You have
 campus students who are benefiting from those rich interactions with
 people around the world, and people around the world being grounded in
 the campus experience and the instructor, educator who's available on
 the campus.

 [07:21] If you can make it work, and we believe we can, then you're
 going to have an even richer learning experience.

 Gayathri: [07:29] I want to backtrack a little and ask you about
 your learning as conversation and about the platform that you
 developed, where you had these kinds of social interactions, where you
 had people commenting on videos, how do you know that they are
 actually learning? How do you know that it actually worked in
 imparting knowledge for students and the learners to take that
 knowledge with them, just like they would in a university?

 Mike: [08:01] It's the hardest thing in education technology is to
 measure effectiveness. We generally don't have any direct measures of
 effectiveness because we can't look inside a person's head and find
 out exactly what they've learned. We've got to look for proxies, we've
 got to look for other evidence of learning.

 [08:23] One of them is learners themselves. We do surveys and
 interviews with all the learners, finding out what it is that they've
 learned and also how they've learned? What processes they've used?
 Whether they have used the conversations to support their learning?

 [08:37] I was particularly struck by one learner who wrote in one of
 those interviews that with normal teaching, it's like in two
 dimensions. You get teaching material and you try to understand it.
 But when you have that social interaction, bringing in other people's
 perspectives, it becomes three dimensions. It gives you another
 dimension, so we've got the direct learner experience.

 [09:02] Then we look at all kinds of other measures. We are
 continually measuring the way in which people learn through the types
 of conversation they have, and whether those conversations are just
 people giving different viewpoints or whether they try to reach
 consensus. We look at outcome measures. How many people complete the
 courses?

 [09:26] We look at progression. Whether people then progress to
 other courses? Whether they progress on to a university study?. There
 are many different methods. There isn't one single method you can use
 to measure this successive learning. You have to come to it from a
 number of different perspectives.

 Gayathri: [09:40] So you triangulate?

 Mike: [09:40] We triangulate.

 Gayathri: [09:41] different kinds of evidence.

 Mike: [09:43] Yeah, different evidence.

 Gayathri: [09:45] Do you think that learning analytics in this sense
 are usable in shaping the future of education?

 Mike: [09:51] Learning analytics are one of these exciting
 opportunities of being able to use the possibilities of very big-scale
 learning, because when you've been working with classes of 30
 children, you can get a certain amount of data, but when you've got
 100,000 people, then it's just a whole new scale of information and
 the data you're going to get.

 [10:16] You can do AB testing, for example. You can give half of
 them one learning experience, half another. You can try out different
 platform features. You can provide dashboards. Visualizations of
 learning for the instructors, for the educators, and even more you can
 feed some of that knowledge and visualization back to the learners
 themselves, so they can see how they're performing.

 [10:40] That's a really effective way of learning. If you can get
 learners to set goals, to say what it is that they want to try and
 achieve, and then see their progress towards those goals, that's a
 very powerful way of learning. Analytics, we're still at the very
 early stages of analytics for learning, but it's going to be a
 powerful tool.

 [11:00] I think the main aim has to be analytics for action. There's
 no point in just collecting a lot of data. You have to know what
 you're going to do with it, how you're going to use it to improve
 learning as it progresses, but also at the end of the course, being
 able to look back at that course and say, how would you make it
 better? How would you make it different? There's a cycle of analytics
 and design which we're still trying to achieve.

 Gayathri: [11:26] We see in these early days of the massive, open
 online courses, a lot of the analytics have focused on the big
 pictures. Using big data mining, they've shown us a lot of trends in
 education, and ways that we can improve our courses, what learners
 want to see.

 [11:47] Do you see that this trend is going to change over the next
 few years? Do you think that they've almost harvested all the low
 hanging fruit, and we need to be focused more on some of the deeper
 lessons that we can learn from here?

 Mike: [12:00] I think so. That sort of data, at the most general
 level, gives you an indication of how the course is progressing, and
 to the instructor, the educator where to focus their intervention. We
 need to go deeper. There's some fascinating work that a colleague at
 The Open University is doing, Zdenek Zdrahal.

 [12:21] He's looking at predictive analytics. What he's done is take
 a lot of data streams, and some very sophisticated ways of analyzing
 those automatically, to be able to predict the learning outcomes from
 just the first couple of weeks. In the first couple of weeks of a
 student's progression through a course, he can predict whether they're
 going to fail or not.

 [12:45] It's not enough just to do that. You've then got to
 intervene. He's providing ways to say, for each individual learner,
 what an educator, what a teacher should do, to try and help that
 learner succeed, whether it's doing more supplementary material,
 taking more tests, getting support from other learners, and then also
 feeding that back to the learners themselves.

 [13:07] What they need to do in order to progress in relation to
 their peers. That sort of predictive analytics is a very new area, and
 there are huge possibilities, because you're going deeper into the
 processes of learning.

 Gayathri: [13:22] One of the findings that we see in our Massive
 Open Online Courses is, learners are coming to the course with
 different motivations. They're not actually there to earn a
 certificate, complete the course, but they might be there to
 experience a particular concept, how to learn and they leave after
 that experience, or if they are satisfied with the amount of learning
 that they have achieved.

 [13:50] In your experience, do you see this? Do you think that our
 learning in our analytics that they're focused too much on retention
 that seems to convey a very incorrect picture of the learning that is
 actually happening on the platform? They're not coming there to
 experience a course throughout. They're coming with a different aim.

 Mike: [14:12] I'm sure that's right, and we've found exactly that.
 In some of our courses, particularly the ones who are aimed at adult
 or continuing learners, or leisure learners, then outcome measure is
 retention. Whether somebody completes a course is a very broad and
 crude measure of the success.

 [14:36] There'll be many people who just want to sample, want to
 gain an understanding. Very often, if the course is well designed, you
 can gain that general understanding of a topic in the first week. It's
 not necessary to carry on to the whole five or six weeks of the
 course.

 [14:54] If a course is well designed, it's a bit like a newspaper
 article where you read the headline, and then you read the first
 paragraph, and then you read the first part of it, and at each of
 those levels, you gain some deeper understanding. If you design the
 course right, there will be people who naturally will drop out in the
 first week, or during the first two weeks, because they'll have
 learned all they need to do. That's fine.

 [15:19] There are other courses, particularly ones for professional
 qualifications, where it's important to achieve mastery, where you
 need to know the stuff in order to become an expert. Whether it's in
 accountancy, or whether it's in cyber security, there are many areas
 where you have to know everything. You have to gain competence. We
 need to design the courses to meet these different sorts of learners.

 Gayathri: [15:46] Do you think that a lot of these can be achieved
 in a Massive Open Online Course and online learning where you do not
 have, for example, a lab facility or something like that? Can you
 still provide mastery learning in many areas?

 Mike: [16:01] Yes, you can. When The Open University was set up,
 over 40 years ago now, it was a huge experiment. There was a lot of
 skepticism about whether you could do that sort of degree level,
 online teaching. We've shown over 30, 40 years that it's possible, not
 just for the areas you might expect, but also, for instance, for
 science.

 [16:25] We have very strong astronomy course at The Open University,
 where our students get access to a remote telescope. They can book
 time on a telescope. They can do observations, they can control the
 telescope. They're not just doing simulated, fake science. They're
 doing real science, with real equipment.

 [16:45] We've got a virtual microscope, where you can look at very
 high definition microscope slides, and zoom in, look at it under
 polarized light. It's pre-prepared slides, but they're working with
 real data, including data they wouldn't be able to get access to at a
 normal university such as digitization of moon rock.

 [17:07] They can look at slides of rock that was collected by Apollo
 astronauts on the moon, that they just wouldn't be able to in a
 traditional university lab. There are lots of things you can do
 online, even with science, that maybe go beyond some of the
 traditional lab classes at universities. There doesn't seem to be any
 area that it's impossible to do.

 [17:33] At Udemy University, I know they've got an online course on
 surgery. You have all the courses training surgeons, but what they do
 is these are people already qualified as surgeons, and they get
 additional training, additional expertise. There doesn't seem to be
 any limits to what you can do at the moment with online learning.
 We're still exploring.

 Gayathri: [17:56] One of the ideas about FutureLearn when you
 designed it with social learning, and learning as conversations, I
 would think it would be very applicable in humanities, where a are a
 lot of discourse needs to happen for learning to be very effective. Is
 this your understanding? Can you tell us a little bit about it?

 Mike: [18:15] Yes. We haven't shied away from humanities learning
 and even controversial topics. One of our courses was on Muslims in
 Britain, another one on climate and climate change. We were prepared
 for lots of very vehement arguments. We found people who were taking
 part in these discussions, who were at odds with the consensus, so we
 had the climate change deniers.

 [18:49] The way the conversations worked was that, the people who
 responded didn't just say, "You're talking rubbish." But they tended
 to respond with, "Well, that's very interesting viewpoint, can you
 provide evidence? Can you justify it?" The community seemed to do its
 own moderation and that was something we were very pleased about and
 also quite surprised about that the community became self-moderating.

 [19:15] If I'd say, the most controversial and most annoying person
 of all of our courses was a Shakespeare denier. Somebody on our
 courses about William Shakespeare who claimed that Shakespeare didn't
 exist and that he didn't write the plays. He was the most annoying
 person that we've ever had to deal with. But we've been pretty
 fortunate and I think that's because we have this self-regulating
 community of learners.

 Gayathri: [19:42] What do you see for the future of colleges and
 universities, particularly as technology shapes that future?

 Mike: [19:51] I think there are a number of possible futures. I
 think some colleges are going to find it very difficult to survive in
 an online world. There may be some traditional colleges and
 universities who just can't cope with the move to online. I think,
 many of them will see it as a new opportunity.

 [20:13] There is a huge need worldwide for higher education. There
 is expanding population of people who are desperate to get access to
 higher education. It's a massive opportunity for universities to
 expand online and to satisfy that need for further and higher
 education.

 [20:36] To do that we've got to move beyond our narrow constituency.
 We've got to look at people from other cultures, other societies,
 we've got to understand how people come to learn online with different
 technologies, different accesses, different political systems.

 [20:51] It's up to us now to try and welcome and accommodate people
 with those differing cultures and viewpoints in technologies. That's a
 challenge. Some universities and not just universities, some other
 institutions will be able to live up to that challenge, some will
 struggle.

 Gayathri: [21:10] Do you think that technology can be used for
 innovations and education beyond what's currently happening?

 Mike: [21:16] There are many innovations that we're just seeing.
 We've produced a series of reports at the university called Innovating
 Pedagogy, where we've put a focus on pedagogy, on teaching, learning
 and assessment and tried to explore some of these innovations that are
 just coming along.

 [21:36] Ones like embodied learning. How can you learn about your
 body and how can you learn with your body? How can you make the most
 use of all of your senses in order to be able to learn?

 [21:49] Cross-contextual learning, so how can we learn across
 different locations and in different locations? Learning on field
 trips, learning in museums, learning at home. How can you connect
 these sorts of learning? How can you make use of the personal devices
 that you have in our pockets?

 [22:06] We've got really powerful learning tools, our mobile phones,
 our tablets, have huge potential for learning. They've got cameras, we
 can do as you're doing now, voice recordings, video recordings.
 They've also got sensors built into them so you can sense your
 environment. You've got temperature sensors, vibration sensors,
 accelerometers. so they're portable science labs.

 [22:33] Each person now with a mobile phone has a portable science
 lab. There are lots of possibilities to make learning much more
 personal with your own mobile and personal technology but also
 shareable to be able to network with other people around the world. I
 think it's an exciting time for education and technology.

 [22:53] All these things that we've talked about 20 or 30 years ago,
 about how technology can enable new forms of conversation, how you can
 develop intelligent tutors, adaptive learning systems, analytics and
 dashboard, they're all starting to happen now and starting to happen
 in big scale. So it's an exciting time.

 Gayathri: [23:11] Do you think there will come a day when we don't
 have courses or classrooms?

 Mike: [23:16] I hope not. Particularly courses because there's
 something about courses that's different to just educational
 materials, and we've discovered this over the last few years. We
 originally started putting up bits of content, open educational
 resources online, a video clip or simulation. I think they were OK but
 they didn't really work as learning resources. It's the putting them
 together into a story, into a narrative that makes them really
 effective.

 [23:47] We have a course on FutureLearn around Forensic Science.
 That's done us almost like a soap opera. Every week you have a
 recreation about murder. They recreated a murder that happened in a
 car. Each week you had to use a different forensic technique to try
 and investigate that murder -- footprint analysis, blood analysis. The
 learners on that course all work together to try and solve this
 murder.

 [24:15] Each week it progressed, you've got more information and it
 was really exciting. The learners were really engaged and you just
 wouldn't get that if you just had one piece or individual pieces of
 learning. It's the course, it's the flow which is supported by the
 learners and the support from trained teachers and educators all
 working together that makes it exciting.

 [24:38] I think we will continue to have courses. We will continue
 to have something like universities. The universities are not just
 about teaching. They're also about research, about a community of
 scholars, people working together to explore knowledge. For some of
 that you need to have them grounded in a real location.

 [24:59] I think universities have been around since medieval times.
 I think they're going to survive a few more years yet. But you're
 going to have a much richer diversity of forms of teaching and
 learning, including online learning that will reach out to people who
 can't get onto the university campus.

 Gayathri: [25:16] Given all these possibilities on the horizon what
 would you like to see happen in educational technology in the next
 three years?

 Mike: [25:24] In the next three years, I would like to see some of
 the things we're doing now, such as learning analytics really working
 to closing that loop of using the analytics to inform the learners,
 using the analytics to inform the design of courses. So really making
 the analytics work for us.

 [25:44] I'd really like to see blended learning working. There is
 good evidence that blended learning is really successful when you've
 got online learners working with campus learners, where you've got
 people taking free courses working with people taking accredited
 courses. I would really like to see those blends working, so that it
 becomes seamless from perhaps watching a T.V. program, taking an
 online course, doing further study.

 [26:11] Lastly, I really want to see learning as a lifelong
 activity. It's not something you just do for a few years during your
 life. It's something that continues throughout your lifetime. The idea
 of supporting a lifetime of learning and a lifetime of people learning
 together so that you get friends for learning for life. That's what
 I'd like to see.

 Gayathri: [26:33] It is exacting to be in educational technology at
 this time, I think. Now we have a standard question we are asking all
 our guests on this podcast, what's your favorite analog educational
 technology?

 Mike: [26:46] My favorite analog educational technology, I guess two
 of them maybe, one is books. FutureLearn is based in the British
 Library and it's just the most wonderful place to work where you're
 surrounded by books. As you go in, you see George III Library just in
 front you. It is the showpiece.

 [27:10] Just being able to be in a world of books and just being
 able to smell and touch the books. I just hope that the feel, and the
 touch and the smell of books are going to survive.

 [27:24] [background music]

 Gayathri: [27:24] I hope so. Thank you Dr Sharples, it was great
