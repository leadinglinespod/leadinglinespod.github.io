## Episode: 18 Carwill Bjork‑James

 [00:00] [music]

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:00] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I am your host Derek Bruff, Director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching. It is spring here in Nashville, which
means it is allergy season, which is why I might sound a little
different today.

[00:16] We have a fascinating interview in this episode today with
Carwill Bjork‑James, Assistant Professor of Anthropology here at
Vanderbilt University.

[00:23] Carwill is on the board of the Wiki Education Foundation, a
non‑profit focused on fostering connections between higher education and
Wikipedia.

[00:31] The foundation has a lot of resources for instructors
interested in having their students contribute to Wikipedia, something
Carwill has doing in his own teaching for several years now.

[00:39] Back in Episode 13 of Leading Lines, I interviewed Tim Foster,
a doctoral student in Spanish and Portuguese, who worked with his
students to build out the Portuguese language Wikipedia page on
Nashville.

[00:49] Tim and Carwill were both on a panel on teaching with
Wikipedia that I helped organize back in the fall.

[00:55] Our interview with Carwill was conducted by Gayathri
Narasimham, associate director of the Vanderbilt Institute for Digital
Learning who met Carwill at that panel.

[01:04] In the interview, Carwill talks about the problem of
representation on Wikipedia, ways he's engaged his students with
Wikipedia, as well as ways he's contributed to the encyclopedia himself
over the years.

[01:14] He makes a strong pitch for faculty to write for Wikipedia,
not really because of their role as scholars, but because of the
teaching that they do.

[01:23] [music]

**Gayathri Narasimham**:  [01:25] Hi, I'm here with Carwill
Bjork‑James, who is assistant professor in anthropology and who is very
involved with Wikipedia. He is also on the board of the Wiki Education
Foundation.

[01:39] Carwill, you've also been on the panel discussing Wikipedia
with Tim Foster a few months back, right?

**Carwill Bjork‑James**:  [01:44] Yes.

**Gayathri**:  [01:45] That's when I actually met you. You're in
anthropology. How did you get involved with Wikipedia? Talk to us about
that relationship and your interest in it.

**Carwill**:  [01:55] I've been an editor on Wikipedia, that's just
anyone who goes online and establishes an account and then adds to the
encyclopedia for about as long as when I went back to grad school to
study anthropology.

[02:08] Those two things weren't necessarily closely linked. I was
more concerned with, "What are the parts of Wikipedia that were
missing?" Right?

[02:20] And trying to fit in. This was in 2005 when I first started
editing. That does really guide my choice of how to use it in the
classroom as well because I mostly used it in a human rights of
indigenous people class.

[02:38] There are over 6,000 indigenous peoples. The coverage of them
is, It varies. Some of them, there's a lot of detailed information and
some there's very little.

[02:49] Also, the coverage of Wikipedia as an encyclopedia is very
uneven based on who has the most access to technology, to economic
publication, and to the particular language communities of the largest
Wikipedia's.

[03:02] I'm interested in making good on Wikipedia's promise to
describe more the world and describe the world evenly, and my students
have the opportunity to do that in their class.

**Gayathri**:  [03:22] Do you do fieldwork where you've actually met a
lot of the indigenous peoples about whom you write in Wikipedia and talk
about?

**Carwill**:  [03:25] My fieldwork is in Bolivia, Bolivia is depending
on you look at either polarity or majority indigenous country.

[03:35] A lot of my fieldwork has been urban, but it's also been with
the ways indigenous movements from outside of the city that try and
influence national policy by coming to the city. It is the case now that
most indigenous people in Bolivia live in cities.

[03:55] Yes, some of the work that I have done is been to cover things
on Wikipedia based on ‑‑ It's been a choice of topics based on whatever
experience in fieldwork, but one of the things that's true about
Wikipedia is its structure is not a place for original research.

[04:22] I can, for example, use one of the interviews that I went to
with an activist on the ground, or go somewhere and see how things are
on the ground and then just go and type that into Wikipedia.

[04:38] Instead, it relies on having published either primary or
secondary sources that can be cited and these citations can be verified
to show things there.

[04:37] It was the case that when I was in the field and dealing with
political conflicts, or social actors, other folks, I would use
Wikipedia as an Agile to do some of the fieldwork I did.

[04:50] When I would look in‑depth at a particular organization say,
The Confederation of Indigenous Peoples of Bolivia, I would try and get
all my notes together about what exactly, when was it founded, what have
they done with their various actions.

[05:06] That stuff is the pure factual information that Wikipedia
thrives on, I would use Wikipedia as a place to put that information up
and out to the world.

**Gayathri**:  [05:21] A common perception about Wikipedia is the
reliability of its sources and its information. You're using Wikipedia
in your research and maybe in your classes to teach your students about
the indigenous peoples that you cover in your research and through your
field work.

[05:40] How do you ensure the reliability of this information? Are
there other online published sources that you can actually ‑‑ you said
you have references you can then verify and so on. That must be a very
important process for your work particularly, right?

**Carwill**:  [05:58] Yes, and I think actually Wikipedia's an
interesting arena, because it is outside of the University space. The
published source that is most reliant on, and most to users, to formal
citation as a method, and so it makes it a very good place to teach
about that process.

[06:21] Here is the case that Wikipedia has developed a reputation
because it is in encyclopedia that anyone can go on and edit. As a place
where people might insert on a reliable information, which I think is a
problem, that there are good tools for dealing with on Wikipedia.

[06:42] The different question of how do you popularly held beliefs or
popularly created probes or master narratives tend to then influence the
way that encyclopedias and other publications are written is the bigger
problem for accuracy with Wikipedia.

[07:04] There's been a number of, particularly in the scientific field
studies comparing, say, Encyclopedia Britannica and Wikipedia on things,
and Wikipedia does quite well in this side by side comparisons. What is
more factual, what is more up to date, and so on, but it varies a lot on
topic.

[07:23] I'm not using Wikipedia primarily as the preferred reference
material for my students. I'm not saying, "Hey, I want you to learn
about the history of indigenous peoples in the United States, so go read
the charity page. Go read."

[07:39] I do, when there are particular events. I know they're both I
and they would consult there, and part of because Wikipedia is the
seventh most common website of all of those, the only one...

[07:53] None of the websites that are higher have mass amounts of
information about actual things, so it is a really important source for
people.

[08:02] Teaching people, when you see that page, don't forget the
citations down below, check up and see what those things are is
important.

[08:12] It's something that we need to be teaching as academics.
[inaudible] read on Wikipedia, and they should read Wikipedia.

[08:20] They should edit Wikipedia when it's wrong. They should cite
the sources that they find below on Wikipedia after they have gone and
checked them.

[08:29] That's [inaudible] part rule that actually every professor
should know just because it is such an important information source for
people in the world today.

**Gayathri**:  [08:44] Do you use Wikipedia regularly in your classes
for teaching? I want to bring up the example when Tim Foster talked
about creating a page about this in Portuguese for his students. The
difficulties that they encountered and how they did it as a class
project.

[09:03] Have you done something similar in your class? Because a lot
of your work is also involving research that's not in the US and
probably in a language that's not English. How have you dealt with these
kinds of difficulties?

**Carwill**:  [09:18] The place where I have then, this semester is my
third time doing this, is in teaching human rights of indigenous
peoples. That is an area where I'd have a structured Wikipedia
assignment that is built up through the course of the semester.

[09:36] Students will pick a topic, and then do library research in
order to provide themselves with the necessary sources, and to really
become acquainted with the topic.

[09:46] In a lot of ways it's similar to a term paper that I might
have in a class. Except for it has to be written in a particular style.
It has to be a neutral point of view encyclopedia article.

[09:59] I tend to have that in dialogue with some other written
product they're also going to produce. I actually think, especially in
areas, they're politically charged or controversial, that there's
something very productive about forcing someone to say, "OK, I have
opinions."

"[10:19] I happened to see all this stuff, but what is it that I know
most objective on a complete level? Let me write all of that out."

[10:26] Then let me say, "Oh, and I also think, maybe, this pipeline
shouldn't be built for the following reasons," or else I also think that
s people have been marginalized in their school. That's unfair, and this
is why. Or I just find other people who have those opinions, and I
properly attribute them.

[10:45] That work is actually a really productive bit of work. At the
same time, there is a narrative function. It's not just that knowing
that even the most "factual" framework is actually shaped by some kind
of underlying cultural narrative.

[11:10] It's something I know as an anthropologist and that I'm
actually spending a lot of time in that class, in addition to saying,
"Oh, there are lots of indigenous peoples around the world but think
about them. Also, asking what is the overall narrative that we have for,
particularly, North American history?"

[11:26] What place is assigned to indigenous peoples, and what do we
see or don't we see about them through that process? How do we rethink
some of these narratives?

[11:37] Often, that means confronting their [inaudible]? It means
remembering that Nashville didn't begin the moment that James Robertson
and John Samir showed up. It also means, looking at a particular
narratives of how history has been told over time.

[11:58] Another thing that we do in this class if we usually read a
text by a historian called James Merrell, who's looked at how are
American Indians figured in US historiography? What ideas are laid into
narratives?

[12:17] One of those ideas, for example, is that Europeans are
settlers and native people are roaming throughout. Then they have
hunting grounds but not territories. Then they don't have countries,
they have different words for their leaders and other things like that.

[12:37] I also have students as an early assignment go through and
find an American history article and say, "Which of these [inaudible]
appear in there, and what can we do about that narration?"

**Gayathri**:  [12:49] This is a very fascinating aspect of Wikipedia
digital that, to me, you're talking about objectivity and not opinions,
and you are talking about finding references to back your claim, even if
you have any opinions that should be backed.

[13:04] Has it been a process of discovery over time for you, teaching
students to use Wikipedia and reading for days, but also creating
content that is also objective in a sense because from what you're
talking about, it's not just the history of anthropology, the people
that you're studying. But it's also the rest of American history, or
world history, for that matter.

**Carwill**:  [13:30] I do think that being a Wikipedia editor, is an
important learning process, including in those moments where multiple
people with multiple points of view are editing the same document.

[13:43] There's a very direct feedback, and push and pull around how
do we understand this term, what is it valuable for, all this kind of
stuff.

[13:55] It changes how you think about knowledge and its production.
There's work that's involved with that, and bringing students along
through that. Some of the work involves that.

[14:11] I tend to think of it as I emphasize the things that are
relevant to the class for doing that. For just practical reasons, I have
a class that's knowledged and so full of socially generated concepts
fits best in is actually my interim class.

[14:31] But I feel like I don't want to do as much technical teaching
with them that says, "How are we going to write, and how are we going to
do this kind of stuff because there's a lot to cover anyway?"

[14:46] Yes, there's a lot. It's actually valuable on both of those
levels. Are they getting the content? Are they thinking through ‑‑ how
do you write about something in a way that it can be shared and neutral?
What does neutral mean, anyway? What kind of knowledge is excluded from
traditional versions of things?

[15:10] Over the longer term, I'd say that some of my writings on and
editing personal writings, I've been in this kind of experimental mode.
What are the things that are natural parts of how we describe something?

[15:25] Say, Wikipedia has a page on an armament, say, a bomb that's
in your ops somewhere over time? Does it just cut this cover, the
caliber and ballistics and other stuff like this, or does it also cover,
"Oh, this was used in this war." "Oh, this changed things in this way.
Oh, this has these consequences."

[15:43] Wikipedia allows us to do is we're generating a spec sheet for
a lot of things, but it isn't just one angle.

[15:54] Presumably, the people who did all this writing before were
concerned with a military audience. Maybe, there's another audience that
says, "Oh, it's that bomb that caused this atrocity in that situation."
How is that a different perspective?

**Gayathri**:  [16:13] That's the most fascinating aspect of
Wikipedia, it's not like a journal. It's very static, or it's not like
an Encyclopedia Britannica, for example, which is also more controlled
in the kinds of entries that can be made.

[16:29] This is more interactive. You get perspectives from different
people, and you have to deal with those perspectives.

[16:35] When you said about teaching your students objective writing,
I think that's a very interesting aspect of using Wikipedia.

[16:44] Unlike any other writing, this is very practical, immediately,
or faced with every sentence, you have to be careful about writing and
attributing the references, and so on. This is great.

[16:57] That brings me to this question. Is this why you chose
Wikipedia instead of any other medium because there's a lot of different
ways where you can add information online?

[17:07] You could create blog posts, and you could create Google docs
or other kinds of base to share information, but Wikipedia is a very
unique way. Tell me why you chose this?

**Carwill**:  [17:22] I do actually, in my intro class, create a
course blog. In both of those formats, you do have this appreciation of,
"I'm writing something that I know other people are going to read." In
that class, I do because it's technically available to other people, but
it's not indexed.

**Gayathri**:  [17:43] Is it available to others/students?

**Carwill**:  [17:46] It would be available to others outside, but
it's also not ‑‑ what am I looking for ‑‑ it's not indexed on search
engines and things like that.

[17:55] It's not very likely that someone would come to it and decide
or that 10 years from now, someone will say, "When you were a freshman,
you thought this, this, and that." It does allow them to respond back
and forth. That's a good medium for when you're exploring, "What are my
perspectives?"

"[18:15] What is my opinion where that's really, and how am I coming
to understand, grappling with an ethical issue or grappling with an idea
that I haven't had to deal with before?" That's a good medium.

[18:27] Whereas Wikipedia also has the interactive, "You put it out
there, other people are going to read it." I can say on my first day,
whatever you write is going to be read by whoever's interested in your
topic in the future.

[18:42] There is a challenge of specialization around it where it's
much more helpful to be able to write something more complete. Maybe,
something that's poorly covered now so that means it would be a bad
thing for an internal world geography class. Man, do we have all of that
stuff pretty well filled out.

[19:06] It's really great for insidious writes class. It's also making
it an option for my graduate theory students as one of their ‑‑ I'm very
much trying to be fair ‑‑ as an option, you can describe an author or
highly referenced text or whatever, write an encyclopedia article all
about it.

[19:30] Those things are tremendously useful, if someone is to
encounter [inaudible] gender trouble for the first time.

[19:41] There's a good encyclopedia article about it. Is it really
helpful to have an outline and some effective things? How did this
influence that, and so on?

[19:55] I had to make some choices. I definitely did some things that
are visible but then don't necessarily reveal everything about the
student, like a permit audience. I'm always very aware of that, that
intensely archived aspect of a lot of the Internet media.

**Gayathri**:  [20:23] That's a very interesting point, and it
actually relates to this next question I thought of asking you is you've
written a lot of Wikipedia articles.

[20:27] Have you had many occasions that you've had to go back and
revise your statements about a particular thing because of more recent
discoveries, recent opinions that have surfaced?

**Carwill**:  [20:40] Sometimes. Wikipedia is a strange medium because
your name isn't sitting out there attached to everything that you've
worked on. I feel like if it were, perhaps I would be a more meticulous
and recurrent updater and probably would have fewer articles that I had
worked on.

[21:03] I do find myself, either defending or amplifying things that
I've written in the past, for sure. You develop, either a sense of
ownership or a sense of concern, shall we say, about particular pieces.
Sometimes, I definitely write opinion pieces. I write academic pieces. I
may write stuff for Wikipedia.

[21:27] Sometimes, I'm deciding which is the medium, that is best to
respond to something. Sometimes, it's just that we don't have a shared
cognitive idea about it, or let me give another example. Something comes
up in a lot of conversation over and over again.

[21:50] I'm writing, using a term, but I wouldn't refer to how that
term is used conventionally, what is it meaning, and so on. For
instance, there is a sub‑section that I've written on the white
supremacy page. It's called "Academic Use of the Term."

[22:11] There is a very different academic usage of white supremacy,
to mean a system of racial inequality, in which white people are at an
advantage. It doesn't mean KKK hoods and revengist, fantastical
positioning around.

[22:33] It doesn't mean overt parading around of the idea that white
people are better. Because so many times that would come up in
conversation, I finally said, "OK. I think I'll write that." This
section of the page that says, "Here are these 10 people who use this
term. Here are some of their formal definitions."

[22:51] Here's how it distinguishes from everything else. Then I
actually don't remember if it was from my personal writing or if it's
somewhere else on Wikipedia, that someone would use that term.

[23:01] I would just say, "OK. You want to know what this is talking
about. They're not talking about this, they're talking about that. Let's
write that up."

[23:09] You then do have the satisfaction that, maybe, that influences
a public dialog, that, maybe, people who are not aware of that, who are
wrestling with that term for the first time, will have a chance.

[23:22] That, maybe, is a reason why even I don't see where much of my
Wikipedia work has been about our race than my academic work because
it's a part of a public dialog. It's just helpful to have information
out there.

**Gayathri**:  [23:37] Also, to have clear concepts of what it is that
they're talking about. That makes a lot of sense.

[23:42] To me, because I'm almost like an outsider coming into these
conversations, it's very helpful to understand these different
terminologies and results for when you said that, in conversation, this
is what it means. Not this, but this, those contrasts.

**Carwill**:  [23:58] The other thing that I would say is that when I
have wrestled with something for a long time and found out a lot
typically for teaching purposes, then I'm very tempted to upload and
share that particular bit of research in Wikipedia. This is also a race
example for what it's worth.

[24:18] I taught this biology and culture of race. There's a lot of
conversation about human genetic clustering, and even how does this map
onto race. It turned out that a lot of this conversation was really
about a 2002 study with a small sample size, and so on. It dominates the
conversation.

[24:39] When Nicolas Wade wrote this very widely reviewed and a lot of
molecular geneticists really frustrated with it, he didn't say, "Let's
go to all the molecular genetics and read all of it." He said, "Oh, just
this study in 2002."

[24:55] Those of us who do hard science or even soft science know that
actually you look for the more recent studies or the larger sample size
with comprehensive methodology I taught in my class.

[25:08] I had my class read through five or six of these different
studies, how are they framed, what has changed over time. I see all of
that.

[25:19] I had charts in lecture notes. I just took that material and
added it to the human genetic clustering Wikipedia page.

[25:26] As much as I like teaching students, there's a side of me that
I would love to give the faculty some of their [inaudible] that says,
"Here's how you take all that work that you're doing that, maybe, you're
not on the frontier of the research.

"[25:41] You're the synthesizer for students and make yourself into
the synthesizer for a broader public."

**Gayathri**:  [25:48] That's a different way to use it right. You've
been talking about how you're using Wikipedia in your class for your
students. This broader way of doing things is also very useful, and it's
also useful for students.

[26:02] You could imagine faculty would think about all the concepts
that they are interested in and the research that's been done. Do a
synthesis of things, and then it'll be a more authoritative work that's
what's out there, that's opinions, that's just this buzz in the
community. That's very interesting.

[26:25] That brings me to the next question, which is, tell us about
the Wikimedia Foundation. What is your involvement with it?

**Carwill**:  [26:33] The Wikimedia Foundation is an institution that
was set up to support, initially, Wikipedia and then a bunch of other
free content projects that spun out from it, including the most
prominent, which are Wikimedia Commons or commons.wikimedia.org.

[26:49] Also, most prominent, Wikidata and Wikisource. Wikidata
sometimes builds structured datasets about factual information.
Wikisource is a place to host text in both. All of these produce free
culture, at least, freely redistributable cultural products.

[27:16] There's a bunch of legal work that is posed around that.
There's a bunch of technical work. The foundation was set up to host
that.

[27:21] Within that project, one thing that people realize they could
do was the kind of educational projects that I'm talking about. About 8
or 10 years ago, people started, within the supportive Wikipedia, these
kind of college‑level education projects.

[27:40] There's lots of community conversation about them. Wikimedia,
by the way, is a democratically run or elected board that comes out of
the Wikimedia community. There are a lot of inter‑person meetings, all
of this stuff.

[27:59] One of those, the education project in the US, came out of
that. Then it came to a point where they decided that they wanted to
scale up.

[28:12] The global Wikipedia community also had a question of where do
we put our resources. Wikimedia education was working predominantly in
the US, spun off into a separate geo called the Wiki Education
Foundation. They're friends.

[28:33] In fact, Wiki Education Foundation will go and provide
software to Wikimedia now. They spun off, formed a new office and began
a new nonprofit about five or six years ago. I've joined the board of
it.

[28:52] There are several of us who are educators, and there are
several of us who are Wikipedians. That overlaps, who are on the board
of it, in addition to some other people who are involved in other
education work or their nonprofit work.

[29:11] It's an organization of about 9 or 10 staff right now, based
in San Francisco. That provides support for higher education teaching
across the country.

[29:17] It has 7,000 students per semester. Right now are editing,
using Wikipedia as part of their assignments, or, in some cases, are
doing critical work or doing writing work or doing other projects.

[29:40] It's been growing rapidly. That represents hundreds of
classes. It's producing substantial, bordering on [inaudible],
percentage of all edited single [inaudible] Wikipedia at this point.

[29:48] It's video. We're really excited about it, and figuring out
ways to support people is the core of its mission because this started
off as a tinkering process. When I was first teaching using Wikipedia
five years ago, Wiki had not spun off yet.

[30:16] The tools available were more limited. Now you, as a
professor, teaching with Wikipedia can get a dashboard where you're
leading all of your students through online training modules where
they're learning about how to write Wikipedia.

[30:35] They're seeing videos, and they're getting to do automatic.
Basically, it's like a MOOC at the beginning.

[30:43] Then it's not a MOOC anymore because it's based on the
[inaudible], but you do have a dashboard where you can see what edits
have my students made? How many characters have they edited? What have
they been up to this week? Are any of those changes directly plagiarized
from other sources? You need to be concerned about that.

[31:04] All of those things have been built in over time. The US
program has built these tools, and then is offering them to any other
programs that do Wikipedia education around the world, to be
re‑localized and put in different language.

**Gayathri**:  [31:26] Is this completely independent of other
organizations? Google, for example, they were going to create a library.
It's independent of that. This is exclusive to Wikipedia and the
educators.

**Carwill**:  [31:41] This is education focused, independent NGO. A
couple of years ago, Google gave a grant, not in exchange for other
services, just because they respected the work. Most of its foundation
funded.

[31:58] But a lot of it is foundations that emerged from the tech
sector because the interest in Wikipedia is strong there.

[32:12] One thing that I think is important to understand about the
Wikimedia community, including Wikipedia, is that it produces free and
open source content.

[32:22] I'm not sure if all of the software is open source, but it's
designed to facilitate the massive and horizontal sharing of knowledge
and other information by producing things there that don't have
copyrights associated with them, or that have created comment licenses
or other things like that.

[32:43] The goal, at least, at Wikipedia, was to have something that
wasn't print encyclopedias, it was to produce a widely disseminatable
doc item.

[32:57] The way to do that was to have content that the authors gave
up at the bottom of every edit page that you're giving up the rights to
the text, the [inaudible] institution, not copy or journal an article
into it.

[33:11] You should produce something that will be freely producible.
It means that there's a tremendous amount of diagrams, and photos, and
video and other things that are being posted through the system. Because
it's such a large user base, people who are not content producers but
who are content users, it's able to fund that pretty well, Wikipedia is.

[33:37] Many, many people will log on in a given day, hundreds of
millions of people. If they do a fund drive, a few days at the end of
the year, they're going to be able to sustain the necessary
infrastructure for all of that.

[33:51] In so many ways, it's one of the most important free content
host sites that have come up with a model to make that sustainable,
which is really important.

**Gayathri**:  [34:03] That's very impressive, and I'm very impressed
that you're on the board of one of 90 producers. That's great. Are you
students out of the group that's editing the 7,000 or?

**Carwill**:  [34:11] They're among the editors.

**Gayathri**:  [34:12] That's awesome. This is great information. If a
faculty wants to be part of this group, can they get information?

**Carwill**:  [34:23] They can go to wikiedu.org. That's the best site
to start out. There are a set of both PDF and physical pamphlets that
have been built over time.

[34:24] This is one of the other things that WikiEd and, to some
extent, the international community, in dialog with one another, has
produced a booklet editing Wikipedia or assessing a Wikipedia article or
illustrating on Wikipedia.

[34:57] Also, increasingly there's been production of subject guides
that say, OK, you're writing an article about a disease or a medical
article. Here's the typical structure of a disease article or of a cell
article or things like that.

[35:13] Make sure these elements are there. Here are some resources.
Here, you can click through to that. Most people have seen the front
face of Wikipedia, maybe, even clicked to the home page.

[35:26] Most people, maybe, have not seen the top pages on the back
and the project pages where people are gathering, and saying, "Oh, a lot
of us write articles about ethnic groups. How can we structure them
similarly? How can you assess them from what is a good and a bad
article? How can we incentivize people to make the best articles?"

[35:45] There's a lot to learn, I would say. But it's not what
WikiEd's role has been is to make that learning as unintimidating as
possible. So that it is definitely possible if people see a semester,
six or eight weeks away, and they're thinking, "I'd love to do this," if
they're on campus.

[36:09] I'd love to talk with them personally. If they are looking at
this from further way, there are definitely a lot of resources through
WikiEd, both printed ones and phone calls and online chats. There are
online office hours for WikiEd to professors.

[36:26] You can certainly, in the middle of the semester, be the
student who says, "Hey, hey, I'm having this crisis. Help me out."

**Gayathri**:  [36:36] This is awesome. We'll definitely have links to
the information that you have here in our podcast page, so that's good
to know.

[36:46] Before we end, I have one final question we'll be asking all
our podcast contributors. What is your favorite analog technology?

**Carwill**:  [36:56] I want to say the analog watch, but I don't know
if this is the best. In a lot of ways, both because they can be crafted
and quite beautiful, and because you can watch something work,
particularly the ones that expose some of their gear work. Where you see
the way they function.

**Gayathri**:  [37:21] Some of them are very expensive, too, like a
lot of Swiss watches.

**Carwill**:  [37:25] Elaborate, yes. I do feel like one of the things
that we're seeing is that, but maybe people didn't expect 15 or 20 years
ago, is that as there's been more and more digital technology where
we're in a generation of digital technology that's interested in
crafting. How do we make physical objects?

[37:49] I feel like when I first started using computers, everyone
thought, "Oh, we're on this track toward virtual everything." No one
anticipated that we might be on a track to using the virtual to create
new physical things.

[38:07] While that's not something that I do, it is something that I
think is fascinating.

**Gayathri**:  [38:17] That's great. I think that's fascinating to me,
what you just said about the creative aspect of it. It may be invisible
in digital technology, it's very obvious in analog where we have to put
things together. Interesting.

[38:21] Thank you very much, Carwill.

**Carwill**:  [38:26] Thank you.

**Derek**:  [38:27] That was Carwill Bjork‑James, Assistant Professor
of Anthropology at Vanderbilt University. In the show notes, you'll find
links to the information about Carwill as well as the Wiki Education
Foundation.

[38:38] After hearing Carwill talk about the foundation's work, I'm
sorely tempted to build a Wikipedia project into my fall first‑year
writing seminar, but I'm already planning a podcast project with my
students. I'm not sure if I've got room for another big project. Too
many ideas, too little time.
