In this episode, we speak with Carwil Bjork-James, assistant professor of anthropology at Vanderbilt University. Bjork-James is a cultural anthropologist whose work focuses on strategies of grassroots autonomy and disruptive protest in Latin America. He serves on the board of the Wiki Education Foundation, a grant-supported non-profit institution, which supports the use of Wikipedia and Wikimedia projects in higher education contexts across the United States and Canada.

In the interview, Bjork-James discusses the problem of representation on Wikipedia, ways he has worked with his students to write for Wikipedia, and how he sees his role as a Wikipedian. This episode’s interview is conducted by Gayathri Narasimham, Associate Director of the Vanderbilt Institute for Digital Learning.
