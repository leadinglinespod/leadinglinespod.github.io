## Episode 19: Enoch Hale

 [00:00] [background music]

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:08] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, Director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching.

[00:11] In this podcast, we explore creative, intentional and
effective uses of technology to enhance student learning, uses that
point the way to the future of educational technology in college and
university settings.

[00:22] In this episode, we feature an interview with Enoch Hale,
Director of Teaching and Learning Excellence at Virginia Commonwealth
University. I've been impressed with the innovative work on educational
technology of VCU for years now.

[00:35] Enoch has been a key player in many of those initiatives. He
has a way of making clear the connection between a piece of technology
and the kinds of student learning we might want to foster with that
technology.

[00:45] We start the interview by talking about three technologies
he's been experimenting with in his own teaching and in his faculty
development work. One quick note. During the interview, I keep
mispronouncing the name of one of the technologies. The tool is called
Flipgrid with an I, not flipgrade with an A.

[01:01] [background music]

**Derek**:  [01:06] Enoch, thanks for being on our podcast.

**Enoch Hale**:  [01:10] Thank you.

**Derek**:  [01:11] We're here at the POD Network Conference, POD
Central ‑‑ Professional and Organizational Development Network. I'm here
because I'm a director of a teaching center and you're here because
you're a director of a teaching center.

[01:20] This is our professional conference, and I'm glad to have a
little time to chat with you while we're here about educational
technology.

**Enoch**:  [01:31] Thank you. I'm honored. This is exciting.

**Derek**:  [01:31] Let's start with something concrete. Can you
describe a project or two that you've been involved with at Virginia
Commonwealth that's used educational technology in interesting ways?

**Enoch**:  [01:41] Let me give you just three quick snapshots. One is
Flipgrid.

**Derek**:  [01:48] Flipgrid. What is that?

**Enoch**:  [01:51] Flipgrid is an online interface. I like it because
students don't have to login. I also like it because I put out a prompt,
a video prompt or a text prompt and then students, send them the link,
they press the button and they have 90 seconds to record their reply.

[02:09] It puts it up on a grid, used according to when students log
on. That's one technology that I've been using. How I'm using it is the
interesting part.

[02:20] [laughter]

**Enoch**:  [02:20] Before I get to that, another one is Timeline JS.
One of my former colleagues introduced me to the Timeline JS design.
It's free. It's designed to create history timelines. What I'm trying to
do with it is have students use it to craft to the narrative of their
intellectual growth over the course of the semester within a given
discipline.

[02:45] It's an act of making the thinking visible, but using Timeline
JS as their medium.

[02:52] The third one is, I'm running it this semester in the class
that I teach, but also my professional work, playing around with
telescopic text.

**Derek**:  [03:13] What is that?

**Enoch**:  [03:14] Telescopic Text is free, but the idea is that you
start out with a platform, a statement that you can make. It's limited
to, I think, 150 characters or something to that effect.

[03:17] You have to unpack a logic to it. What it is is it's an
elaboration tool. You can highlight a particular word, and then type in
your elaboration. What you see is just a highlighted word, but as soon
as you click on that, it unpacks. It telescopes. You can go on and on
and on and on.

[03:42] I think, once again, the excitement of that is how it's being
used. [laughs]

**Derek**:  [03:49] Three tools. All free, right?

**Enoch**:  [03:52] Flipgrid, it costs \$60 a year.

**Derek**:  [03:55] The other two are free. You're using some in your
own teaching, but then...

**Enoch**:  [04:02] All in my own teaching.

**Derek**:  [04:03] All in your own teaching.

**Enoch**:  [04:03] And in faculty development. The telescopic text,
we're just playing around with faculty right now, but I used the
Flipgrid, for example, in our Learning Spaces Fellows Program. The idea
was they needed to reflect on their experiences in this experimental
classroom. Movable furniture, amazing technology...

**Derek**:  [04:24] These are faculty who were teaching in active
learning space classroom?

**Enoch**:  [04:30] Yes, correct.

[04:30] When I got them together, the reflections were fine but they
had a hard time, beyond that of just a loose, informal at times
dialogue, like recording it. We have a WordPress site, rampages/spaces,
acts as a mother blog to pull into their blogs.

[04:48] I give them prompts, and they're to blog about that, but some
of them aren't doing that. Some thrived in the blog environment, others
it just seems too big of an investment, so I use Flipgrid.

**Derek**:  [05:02] Tell me more about Flipgrid. What does it look
like? How does it work?

**Enoch**:  [05:07] If I have my account, I create a grid. What that
grid is, it's like one topic, let's just say. I have a grid called
Learning Spaces. Within that, I can have multiple questions. Each
question represents one experience.

[05:24] I'll submit a question, and once again I like it because
students don't have to log on, but it's similar to, not totally similar,
but I'm thinking in a VoiceThread.

[05:38] That interfaces in our LMS system. I like that, but students
have to have a unique login and we're just working out the bumps there.
I think, as a comprehensive tool, VoiceThread is tremendous, but
Flipgrid is great for capturing micro experiences.

[05:53] I've put out a prompt. I tend to like video prompts. Students
watch the prompt. They respond to my question. They have 90 seconds.

**Derek**:  [06:04] Through video, or audio, or text?

**Enoch**:  [06:06] It's all video.

[06:09] They can create an avatar if they want, but from their phone,
their computer. That's the one requirement, is they have some type of
digital tool.

[06:17] We do our best with students to make those available. The
faculty really liked it because it's a pretty low investment, in terms
of time.

**Derek**:  [06:24] If I'm on my phone, I'll just capture the video
with my phone's camera, or if I'm at my laptop, I'll just use the
webcam.

**Enoch**:  [06:30] That's part of the fun. It's also part of the
challenge because you're sitting there in the middle of student commons
and you might get a lot of background noise. Another time, you'll have
students at home, I had one student, a grad student, he was in his
backyard and he used fire as a metaphor to capture his...

[06:45] [crosstalk]

[06:45] [laughter]

**Derek**:  [06:45] They could shoot live on location, wherever they
need to be.

**Enoch**:  [06:51] I presented some of my initial findings with
faculty and also using Flipgrid at a conference at University of
Tennessee this last year, for the Learning Spaces Conference.

[07:02] I do think it's important to say that the way I'm trying to
use technology and my own instruction and in faculty development
isn't...here's an interesting tool. I like the metaphor of a tool. I
think it's also overused and often abused. I want to use technology that
is generative.

[07:22] Meaning, I want it to be necessary in cultivating the insights
or skills or dispositions that I want to emerge from the learning
experience within that particular discipline or course. In other words,
I want it to be like an insight generator.

[07:40] If I was to put this as a question, is the technology
necessary for the insight that I want to emerge? Now, in many cases, I
think the tools aren't necessary. If they're not necessary, and I should
say, I want to use the word necessary, that's what I look for. That's my
criteria.

[08:03] Integral, might be a better, more accurate term. If it's not
integral to the learning experience, then oftentimes I have to ask as a
faculty developer, how much investment do I have to put in to actually
help faculty to see its merit?

[08:18] There's learning curves involved with some of these things.

**Derek**:  [08:22] Something like Flipgrid?

**Enoch**:  [08:23] Flipgrid.

**Derek**:  [08:22] Right. Let's think about the learning spaces group
that you've got. In what sense is that integral to the kinds of
conversations you want to have with that group?

**Enoch**:  [08:32] With faculty, it's pragmatic, in a sense that it's
solving a problem of capturing and reflections.

**Derek**:  [08:39] You wanted to hear from everyone. You wanted them
all to be reflective. When you got them together in the room together,
you would hear from some, but maybe not all.

**Enoch**:  [08:48] There's also more of an organic conversation. It
became more integral to the type of thinking we wanted to cultivate when
‑‑ number one, I said was, what's the thinking direction? I'm putting
thinking first. What's the insight I want to emerge, or release this
skill I want them to practice.

[09:06] When I have faculty interfacing with Flipgrid, for example,
I'm able to scaffold out a series of questions that provides them a
concentrated lens. They have to think concisely. They're having to,
actually, do quite a bit of forethought to...

**Derek**:  [09:20] There's a time limit on the video?

**Enoch**:  [09:23] Yeah. 90 seconds.

**Derek**:  [09:24] 90 seconds, OK.

**Enoch**:  [09:23] I'm talking about elaborating. I'm elaborating a
lot. [laughs] Really. The art is being concise. Finally, crafting
those experiences so that it encourages faculty to listen to others. I
say faculty, but I mean students as well. For example, I'll put a
Flipgrid out. I'll say, "All right."

[09:41] First question is, let's just say, what was the insight that
your students came to as a result of shifting their furniture? They
said, "Now, you're the first person to see this is going to answer that
question, but then you're going to ask a question."

[09:55] The second person to logon is not only going to re‑see my
prompt, but has to listen to the first person to get their question.

**Derek**:  [10:05] There's a chain in the effort.

**Enoch**:  [10:08] There's a chain and it encourages students'
listening to each other, faculty to listening to each other. Faculty are
much more interactive.

**Derek**:  [10:15] If I'm the fourth, I don't have to listen to all
three that preceded me, but I have to listen to the one that preceded
me.

**Enoch**:  [10:21] That's correct.

[10:22] What I found that with faculty ‑‑ of course a lot easier.
People, actually want to hear what others have to say. This is a very
beneficial thing like VoiceThread where you can have text options. It's
a much more inclusive technology as well. That way, students can see the
chain of conversation.

[10:38] With Flipgrid that's not its purpose. Its purpose is to
capture individual reflections, but I want to use it also as an
opportunity to encourage of a greater discussion, that we can then
transfer into the classroom or to continue the conversation in another
modality.

**Derek**:  [10:54] Just for clarity, you talked about using this, it
suits your own students, what types of questions might you have them
address?

**Enoch**:  [11:01] Content‑based questions. One of the classes I
teach is a graduate class on teaching, learning, and technology, and the
future of higher education.

**Derek**:  [11:09] Sounds like a great topic.

[11:11] [laughter]

**Enoch**:  [11:11] I think so, yeah. We're talking about, "OK, let's
just talk about digital engagement specifically in cultivating, and
crafting online discussion, and what is active listening look like in
that environment. I would put forth that question.

[11:25] I can identify specific lens and this is what I say. I can
give a broad question or I can say something to the effect. Identify two
assumptions that the author made within this argument, and what are
their implications, for the broader discourse?

**Derek**:  [11:40] Flipgrid, you mentioned that there's this element
of concession. You got 90 seconds and you've got...Now, you also talked
about...What was your text expander tool?

**Enoch**:  [11:51] Telescopic Text.

**Derek**:  [11:52] Telescopic Text?

**Enoch**:  [11:53] Yeah.

**Derek**:  [11:53] It seems to work in the opposite direction.

**Enoch**:  [11:55] It's an elaboration tool. Telescopic Text is
fascinating, because as I'm using it, I'm putting the thinking first. I
think that's where technology becomes powerful and integral to the
learning experience.

[12:07] It's like Clickers or you're doing poll everywhere. When you
can see yourself in relation, the data visualization is where that
becomes something that is...

**Derek**:  [12:17] I'm that bar graph. I'm that part of the bar
graph.

**Enoch**:  [12:20] Exactly. You're seeing yourself within it and
that's what I'm looking for. Technology where people can see their
thinking development within it, see themselves. Their identity becomes
part of the experience. Like Telescopic Text, the first objective is to
take a reading, for example. In my case, I took my syllabus.

[12:40] [laughter]

**Enoch**:  [12:40] What's the essential question that I want to ask
that this course is always going to go back, and I boiled it down to
that one question.

[12:49] The question for this particular course, an undergraduate
course called Inquiry and the Craft of Argument, is to people make
decisions about what to believe and do based on sound reasoning. That's
all that is written there.

**Derek**:  [13:01] [laughs] It's a big question.

**Enoch**:  [13:02] It's a big question.

**Derek**:  [13:03] It's the essential question for your course.

**Enoch**:  [13:05] That was a lot of intellectual work to distill all
these questions that they're going to be thinking through. What is it
all going back to? That's my insight from backwards design, for example.
That's a tenant of a course.

[13:19] That's one skill, is being to take an article, being able to
take a lecture, and condense it down to its essential question or
elements, or I was saying claims.

[13:31] [crosstalk]

**Enoch**:  [13:32] Exactly. They have to elaborate on that, then
identify specific concepts that we're not going to take for granted,
that we have a shared understanding, but they're going to unpack them.
Elaboration is being able to make connections between related ideas in
order to create a map of understanding of that particular concept.

**Derek**:  [13:54] For your essential question, do people make
decisions based on evidence? You might take the word evidence and expand
that.

**Enoch**:  [14:02] Exactly. I say, "Do you?" instead of, "Do people?"
I say, "Do you?" Another one idea is, for example, what the question as
it started to unpack is to people make decisions, inferences, beliefs
based upon sound well‑reasoned, justified, and valid arguments rather
than tradition group thinking way of persuasion. Those were the
unpacking.

[14:28] The next question came up, "Should we?" Now I highlighted we
and you presses "we," it says, "Is it important to do so?" Highlighted
so. What are the consequences if we don't?

[14:39] Highlighted consequences and don't, but consequences says,
"No, implications." The consequences are things that have actually
happened. I wanted to shift that or highlighted implication.

**Derek**:  [14:50] I'm reminded a little bit of a good Prezi, where
you see the big picture, but then you zoom in on one piece, and start to
unpack that a little bit, and you can zoom in again. It sounds like this
is in some way, it's a text version of that as you...

[15:02] [crosstalk]

**Enoch**:  [15:02] I even thought of it that way, but that's exactly
right. That's why I like Prezi since that you can see the big picture at
any time. The challenging part of Telescopic Text and why I love it so
much is it's hard enough for students to find the essential claim or a
question. It's also hard for them to be mindful of the concepts that
need to be elaborated.

[15:25] To map that out, so that the tool works, is an amazingly
difficult process, because you're having to, in essence, layout the
logic so that if you unpack any word, whatever it is, the sentence still
reads, because you can mess it up. All of sudden, that's not doing what
it needs to do.

[15:47] They actually have to create this logic maps on the
whiteboards that show where they're going to unfold and then build it.
This Telescopic Text given those goals right now is integral. When I
build in a reflective metacognitive activity within it, it becomes a
necessary condition for the type of thinking I want to cultivate.

**Derek**:  [16:14] I'm thinking of my photography course that I teach
where we looked at questions of surveillance, and security, and privacy.
There's a simple way to ask that question. Should the government be able
to read all of our emails? Any little piece of that can get exploded in
different ways.

**Enoch**:  [16:32] Isn't it that what the essence of academia is
about? It's being able to ask a question about some phenomena [laughs]
and think through its implications. It's seeing complexity. I'm trying
to find tools that are seemingly simple ‑‑ Flipgrid, Telescopic Text ‑‑
and use them in extraordinary ways. Now I am expert at it? No.

[16:57] [laughter]

**Derek**:  [16:57] I think we have to try.

**Enoch**:  [16:58] Am I trying?

[16:59] This is the part that I'm excited about, is that when I see a
new tool, my initial consumption of it is, "Oh, here's a tool." When I
take the concept tool and set it aside and say, "Oh, how is it a
generator? What's the thinking?"

**Derek**:  [17:15] What thinking does it foster or help?

**Enoch**:  [17:19] Help me foster, yeah.

[17:22] Something happens in my own mind. I know I'll become excited;
I begin to see on layout my plan for growth. I did a survey of faculty.
It's just an informal survey on my own institution saying, "All right,
how many of you have a plan of development for your scholarship?" 98
percent have.

**Derek**:  [17:44] Everyone's got a plan.

**Enoch**:  [17:46] Good for your service, over 60 percent did. How
about for your teaching? One. We're talking about over a hundred faculty
that I...one.

**Derek**:  [17:52] One has a plan for developing your teaching over
time?

**Enoch**:  [17:56] Yeah. I want to think, "Well, what's my plan for
developing my own competencies. Not just knowledge. I think it parallels
in part how students often see coursework as a one‑way transactional
input/output. I think the technology has a real power, if the thinking
is put first to actually be a generator of insights.

**Derek**:  [18:21] Let's move to your other example, Timeline JS. How
are you using that with students?

**Enoch**:  [18:26] This was an interesting...

**Derek**:  [18:27] Interested meta cognition happening here too,
right?

**Enoch**:  [18:28] Yeah. I ask myself, "OK, what is the one content
insight? If nothing else happens, what's the one content insight I want
to have them walk away with?" That's easy enough. I was like, "What's
the insight that I want them to have about how they learn?" That
requires tracking.

[18:46] Oftentimes, we track with journals. I don't want to read more.

[18:50] [laughter]

**Derek**:  [18:50] You have enough to read.

**Enoch**:  [18:52] I have enough to read and I don't want to read
that.

[18:57] [laughter]

**Enoch**:  [18:57] I'm trying to use technology as a way to condense,
but also visualize the thinking, their narrative of intellectual growth.

[19:07] Here's the thing, students don't necessarily, in my
experience, I don't want to over generalize, but think about taking BIO
101 from the point of view, "All right. not what am I going to learn,
but what am I going to learn about learning? Can I track my intellectual
growth?"

[19:23] That's what I want to focus on because we have a lot of
investment in general education. We have a lot of investment in the
claim that there's transferable skills.

[19:31] Our insights are dispositions. Timeline JS was an opportunity
for me using a free tool for students to begin to craft a narrative over
time. Timeline JS allows you to...it's a timeline. For each marker, it
allows you to put an artifact. Video, a student can make a video or find
a video.

[19:53] A picture, a chart, a diagram, or a PDF copy of their paper.
When they say, "Yeah, I have cultivated, become more skilled in asking
questions of clarification that target an author's assumptions. I've
done this in class. I also do it in my work." Here's an example.

[20:15] At the beginning of the term, this article, I didn't notice
this, but at the end of the term, here's examples from my work. They
just put PDF picture. That's been tremendous. I think, the secret though
is less is more in that case.

[20:33] [laughter]

**Enoch**:  [20:32] All the different intellectual moves and skills.
We work through targeting and focusing on just a few, really helps
students see visually how often, just with asking clarifying questions,
examples and definitions and elaborations.

[20:48] How often we do that work, but we don't necessarily do it
mindfully and strategically. It becomes more implicit, we hope.
[laughs] I question its consistency in application.

[21:00] When I can throw it out there, let alone more complex
intellectual moves, but when I can put it out, I can help students see
like, "Look at the work you've done in here intellectually and how
you've grown or not." [laughs]

**Derek**:  [21:16] Do they build this timeline retrospectively? Do
they add to it as they go during the semester?

**Enoch**:  [21:21] We add to it as we go during the semester.

[21:24] At the end though, I want a comprehensive timeline. What I
also like about all three of these tools is they can upload visually by
virtue of the link, even Flipgrid like an LMS, at least our LMS with
blackboard, or a WordPress site.

[21:40] I can put it up on my course sites and it's really exciting
because then I can share it with faculty and say, "Well, yeah, you could
say Timeline JS isn't something you really can do." I did it. My
students do it. They're sophomores and yours are seniors.

[22:00] We have these amazing claims that, by virtue of going through
this Biology program, you can think like a Biologist. It turns out we
cater to the elite students.

[22:11] I believe that if we're going to live up to the ideals of what
true liberal education can provide, then we have to have those meta
cognitive components and the visualization. I learned, of course, a lot
from your concept map. First, your note mapping exercise, and that's
what it is ‑‑ making the thinking visible so that it can be a guide for
development.

**Derek**:  [22:34] I love that.

**Enoch**:  [22:37] Those are three examples that I've been working on
lately.

**Derek**:  [22:41] It sounds like Flipgrid, you're using the tool as
the producer of the tool intended. It's called Flipgrid, right?

**Enoch**:  [22:49] It's Flipgrid.

**Derek**:  [22:50] Flipgrid.

**Enoch**:  [22:50] Grid.

**Derek**:  [22:50] I keep saying grade.

[22:52] [laughter]

**Derek**:  [22:52] Flipgrid. That makes more sense. With the timeline
tool, this is an off‑label use, right?

**Enoch**:  [22:58] Yeah.

**Derek**:  [22:58] It's not what you think of as a timeline.

**Enoch**:  [23:02] That's right.

**Derek**:  [23:02] The tool allows these types of interactions and
creativity and documenting and you're using it for a very particular
educational purpose.

**Enoch**:  [23:13] You've seen other people, and I've done it myself,
try to capture those student narratives of developments, from blog posts
to something like Logster.

**Derek**:  [23:20] Portfolio of some sort?

**Enoch**:  [23:22] Portfolio, yeah. You would talk about e‑Portfolios
on it. I'm trying to use technology ‑‑ one, free. [laughs]

**Derek**:  [23:28] That helps.

**Enoch**:  [23:29] In a way, that expands my understanding of what's
possible because those other tools are designed to do that. Therefore,
they have limitations.

[23:38] Oftentimes, even if students are interfacing with those, if we
just flip it, just nudge it a little bit with a tool that's on the
fringes, not for that purpose...

**Derek**:  [23:49] It wasn't designed for educational purposes.

**Enoch**:  [23:51] it can really shake things up.

**Derek**:  [23:54] The other thing I heard you say earlier is that
this idea of experimentation and innovation. I think, sometimes, I hear
from faculty, this worry that, "Oh, I'm not going to adopt this tool or
this practice if I can't see evidence that it works."

[24:06] In general, that's probably a good response. We don't want to
just start doing stuff that doesn't make sense.

[24:11] If there aren't some of us at least, who are willing to
experiment with some new thing, and figure out what it can do and what
it can't do and how it taps into student learning, we'll never know if a
timeline tool could be used for this type of meta cognition. Someone's
got to kick the tires and see if that works.

**Enoch**:  [24:29] Yeah, I agree completely. I also think there're
certain technologies that faculty can see the immediate. They don't need
evidence to say, "Oh, this overhead projector."

[24:41] [laughter]

**Enoch**:  [24:42] Oh, this document camera. Show me that thing is
going to lead to the insights." No. Why? Because it translates
immediately into their existing practice. It's just a way of augmenting
it.

[24:54] The thinking though, if we put the thinking first, then I
think we have many more opportunities to engage with things because
people can use an overhead projector, although I haven't seen one for
years.

[25:06] [laughter]

[25:06] They could use it superficially or they could use it in a way
that's outside of the norm. It depends on how they're trying to get
students to see and think.

[25:17] I think that, though, as far as faculty development goes, I
don't care if it's Rubric or something like Telescopic Text, faculty
have to see how it functions.

**Derek**:  [25:30] What it looks like in practice?

**Enoch**:  [25:33] Done well. Not just executed well, but cultivating
the type of insights that really mean something to them, that resonate
with them.

**Derek**:  [25:43] Our podcast is called Leading Lines. We're not
trying to predict the future, necessarily, it's shape the future. As you
think about where educational technology might go in the next two to
three years, where would you like it to go? How would you like faculty
to use it?

**Enoch**:  [25:55] Personally, because of my orientation, I'm not an
educational technologist. I'm an educator who's interested in multiple
modalities, by which to engage a thinker.

[26:10] I would love to see educational technology move in the
direction that is seriously considering ways to help cultivate the
habits of mind.

[26:20] Those dispositions of curiosity, integrity, perseverance,
flexibility, playfulness. [laughs] There's so many that
open‑mindedness as a way to use tools that that's where the tool's
intended to go. Other things are going to be involved, in terms of
skills.

[26:41] If we can think about technology as a way to, actually, look
at the world, I mean there are certain technologies that do that but
they're not necessarily dispositions that we want. For example, we
Facebook. If you put Facebook on your phone, it's appealing. It's easy.

[26:58] It's remarkably egocentric at times. [laughs]

[27:01] Not necessarily, always. What can we do to develop tools that
get students to think about their thinking in a way that, "Yeah, I can
evidence. This tool's actually a lens by which I can think more
creatively." I know there's a lot of tools out there that help do that.

[27:23] If we put those type of thinking goals first, I think it might
resonate a lot more with higher education. Another area I'm very
interested in, Kaizena'd be an example of an LMS that allows for this,
in part.

[27:37] What would technological resources look like if they're
helping us cultivate the type of thinking that we'd like to see within
the discipline? Timeline JS, thinking like a historian, in part. Kaizena
allows for you to put scientific equations within and build those.
That's more of a discussion forum.

[28:02] What does it mean to think like a biologist or like a
historian or a literary critic? How can we develop tools where the
learning curve, that's not just augmenting, it becomes integral to the
learning process? I'm curious. I think it's called Arizma.

[28:17] What they did is you could take your iPad and if you download
the Arizma app, they have some pre‑loaded things. It's as if you see it
as a Mona Lisa. See the Mona Lisa and hold your iPad up and what you
actually see is it move.

**Derek**:  [28:37] Yeah?

**Enoch**:  [28:38] It moves. You put it up to an empty wall because
you picture a Mona Lisa, but then she begins talking, or she begins
moving. I would love to see something like that. What would it look like
if I went to a historical area? Richmond is full of Lumpkin's Jail, for
example. Slave quarters. Jailhouse for slaves.

[28:54] You could hold your iPad up there and see some type of
rendering of here in this spot because when you're holding that up to
the wall, you see the wall but that allows this image to emerge. God,
that would be so mind blowing. [laughs]

[29:22] I think that part of the difficulty of thinking within
discipline is not having a visceral reaction to mitochondria [laughs]
or mitosis, like being able to see that. Right now our main medium doing
so is video.

[29:33] That's more accessible now. I'd like to see Habits of Mind and
Disciplinary Forms of Thinking begin to emerge. I have my own other
interest too. Going back to that question, do people make decisions
based on, to believe and do, on sound reasoning.

[29:49] I would love to see tools that really help the populous gain a
greater confidence in what quality reasoning does for us.

[30:00] What that tool is? I don't know, I'm not that guy.

[30:05] [laughter]

**Derek**:  [30:04] What I'm also hearing is some of these tools are
going to be discipline specific.

**Enoch**:  [30:09] That's OK.

**Derek**:  [30:12] We might need folks who know the discipline well,
who can help craft and shape what those tools look like. It's one thing
to take WordPress, which is a generic blogging platform. You can do all
kinds of things with WordPress.

[30:23] It's not tailored for one particular use. Whereas, some of the
tools that you are imagining are much more from the disciplines and
would have to build disciplinary thinking into the tool itself in some
really significant way. I think that's a big challenge actually.

**Enoch**:  [30:38] I would agree. A possible workaround, you think
about what does it mean to think like a biologist? There's broader
intellectual moves at play. They're just contextualized around specific
questions within the field.

[30:51] If we scale it up to think what does it mean to look at
something in nature and ask the question as a biologist would ask a
question. You're not asking a theological question. You're not
necessarily asking a mathematical question. You're asking a biological
question.

[31:08] It's the act of asking a question within a particular lens.

[31:12] The tool might focus on asking questions and then give the
user an opportunity to then contextualize that according to the theories
and insights and knowledge that inform the discipline.

[31:25] Because all disciplines are based upon certain assumptions,
are dealing with a network core set of questions, and they have specific
methodologies that help advance that. Those are transdisciplinary types
of things. Maybe a workaround is focusing on the thinking, and then
allowing it to be contextualized.

**Derek**:  [31:47] Most of what we talk about on this podcast is
digital educational technology. What's one of your favorite analog
educational technologies?

**Enoch**:  [31:54] Whiteboard markers.

**Derek**:  [31:58] Yeah? [laughs]

**Enoch**:  [31:58] Whether it's a wink wall you write, [laughs] I
love that.

**Derek**:  [32:04] What kind of wall?

**Enoch**:  [32:05] A wall. It's a paint. It's a whiteboard paint. It
turns the wall into a whiteboard.

**Derek**:  [32:11] The whole wall is a whiteboard?

**Enoch**:  [32:14] Yeah, or movable whiteboards or whiteboards enough
for all students to begin to map out their thinking with whiteboards.

[32:15] It's funny because a learning space is one of our innovative
classrooms has whiteboards, has multiple boards of projections, movable
furniture, consistently faculty say their favorite technology in the
room is the whiteboard.

[32:28] [laughter]

**Enoch**:  [32:28] You can talk to somebody in China. They're like,
"Yeah, but I need to lay something out on the wall here."

[32:36] [laughter]

**Derek**:  [32:36] Have students draw out whatever they're thinking,
or share a problem with someone else.

**Enoch**:  [32:41] Whiteboards.

**Derek**:  [32:41] I like it. Thank you very much, Enoch.

[32:44] [background music]

**Enoch**:  [32:44] Thank you, Derek.

**Derek**:  [32:48] That was Enoch Hale, Director of Teacher and
Learning Excellence of Virginia Commonwealth University. Enoch mentioned
several fascinating technologies.

[32:54] In the show‑notes, you'll find some links to those
technologies as well as more information about Enoch and his work at
VCU. You can find our show‑notes in our website, leadinglinespod.com. We
welcome your comments and questions there, and on Twitter where out
handle is @leadinglinespod.

[33:09] If you have experimented with Flipgrid, Telescopic Text, or
Timeline JS, I would love to hear about your experiences either on our
website or on Twitter.
