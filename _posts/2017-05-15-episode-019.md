In this episode, we feature an interview with Enoch Hale, Director of Teaching and Learning Excellence at Virginia Commonwealth University.  He has been involved in a variety of innovative teaching and learning projects at VCU, and he has a way of making clear the connection between a piece of technology and the kinds of student learning we might want to foster with that technology.  In the interview, Enoch talks about three technologies he’s been experimenting with, in his own teaching and in his faculty development work, and he points to some general principles of teaching with technology.
