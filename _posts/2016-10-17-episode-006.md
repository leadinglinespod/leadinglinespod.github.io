In this episode, we feature two interviews conducted by [Cliff Anderson](http://library.vanderbilt.edu/scholarly/), the Director for Scholarly Communications at the Vanderbilt library.  Both interviews focus on [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/), an open source platform that can be used to visualize and analyze data and connections among data.

Cliff interviews his Vanderbilt library colleague Suellen Stringer-Hye, Linked Data and Semantic Web Coordinator.  Suellen has worked with a number of faculty members and students here at Vanderbilt, helping them use Neo4j in their research.  In the interview, she talks about some of those projects and how a database tool like Neo4j can be easier to use than one might think.

In the second interview, Cliff interviews Michael Hunger, who handles developer relations for Neo Technology, the company that has developed Neo4j.  Michael shares a few more examples of how Neo4j has been used and how it supports collaborative data visualization and analysis.

##Episode 6: Suellen Stringer Hye and Micheal Hunger

 [00:00] [music]

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:05] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching. In this podcast, we explore creative,
intentional, and effective uses of technology to enhance student
learning, uses that point the way to the future of educational
technology in college and university settings.

[00:23] In this episode, we feature two interviews conducted by Cliff
Anderson, the director of Scholarly Communications at the Vanderbilt
Library. Cliff is a librarian and a leader here in Vanderbilt's Digital
Community's efforts, and he's always bringing to my attention powerful
new tools for scholarship and teaching.

[00:37] Both of his interviews focus on one such tool, called Neo4j,
an open‑source platform that can be used to visualize and analyze data
and connections among data.

[00:46] Cliff interviews his Vanderbilt Library colleague, Suellen
Stringer‑Hye, who has an awesome job title, Linked Data And Semantic Web
Coordinator. Suellen has worked with a number of faculty members and
students here at Vanderbilt, helping them use Neo4j in their research.

[01:00] In the interview, she talks about some of those projects and
how a database tool like Neo4j can be easier to use than one might
think.

[01:07] In the second interview, Cliff interviews Michael Hunger, who
handles developer relations for Neo Technology, the company that
developed Neo4j. Michael shares a few more examples of how Neo4j has
been used, including, as I learned listening to the interview, in the
analysis of the Panama Papers, a set of 11 million financial documents
leaked earlier this year.

[01:27] First, however, Cliff talks with Suellen Stringer‑Hye here at
Vanderbilt about Neo4j and about the kinds of graphs that it uses to
make sense of data.

[01:36] [music]

**Cliff Anderson**:  [01:39] Hi, this is Cliff Anderson, and I'm here
for the Leading Lines Podcast. I'm the director for Scarlet
Communications in the Vanderbilt University Library. I also work across
the campus with our friends in supporting education technologies in
various fields.

[01:56] I'm here today with Suellen Stringer‑Hye, who is our
coordinator for Linked Data and the Semantic Web, in the Vanderbilt
University Library.

[02:04] Good morning, Suellen.

[02:06] Suellen Stringer‑Hye: Hi, Cliff.

**Cliff**:  [02:08] I just wanted to ask you some questions about the
way in which you've been using graphs, in particular, to teach students,
and how that fits into our overall education technology program. Before
we get there, why don't we just start introducing who you are and how
you got to the point where you are in librarianship?

**Suellen**:  [02:32] OK great. My name is Suellen Stringer‑Hye, as
you said, and I've been working in the Heard Library now for about 20
years. I started off working in Special Collections and then, when the
new online catalog was coming on, that was Acorn way back when, I
started getting interested in technology and so I started working with
that wing of the library.

[03:03] It was at that time called Library Information Technology
Services. Worked for many years doing Web development and support for
various services that the library provides electronically. When Cliff
came on board for the scholarly communications team, it opened up a
window for me to do what I've been interested in in a long time, which
was work on linked data and the semantic Web.

**Cliff**:  [03:37] In fact, I think we might mention that the way
that I've discovered your interest was reading some articles you had
written on a subject called, "Topic Maps," which were a really
interesting technology that never really took off but thinking about how
to model objects and relationships using graphs in XML.

**Suellen**:  [03:57] Yeah, it was probably the background that gave
me...I had become fascinated by going to some XML conferences and
meeting some people there who were developing XTM that stands for XML
for Topic Maps. That was developed out of some people who were working
on back of the book indexes and they were trying to come up with an XML
serialization that would allow them to do the kinds of things you do
with back of the book indexes electronically or digitally.

[04:40] It was really fascinating, for various different reasons never
really took off. RDF supplanted it in a lot of ways but it did give me
the background to understand how valuable it can be to use graphs for
various educational technologies.

**Cliff**:  [05:00] Let's talk a little bit about that. I think one of
the interesting things about graphs in particular is that they're really
everywhere. In thinking about the use of graphs as an education
technology, first, I think we should probably put a caveat and you can
make this point better than I, that we're not talking about bars and
charts here. We're talking about something else.

**Suellen**:  [05:28] We're talking about what's essentially a
mathematical graph, which means it has a lot of nodes and edges.
Basically, and back to the Topic Map model, you have topics or objects,
and then relationships between those.

[05:48] The reason that that is so useful in terms of modeling
information is that in the past we used to have to model information
with embedded relationships because we could use hierarchies, but we
never really could code the interconnections between things.

[06:06] I often say it's a lot like in the old days when you'd go to
the card catalog and you'd get to see also reference. In order to find
and see that reference, you pick yourself up and walk over to the other
place where that was. This is just a way to code those relationships so
that we can do various things with them.

**Cliff**:  [06:31] What I think is interesting is once you start
thinking along the lines of a graph model you begin to see that lots and
lots of things that we encounter in our daily life can be modeled easily
as graphs. I think that's where it comes in for an education technology.
This is a technology that runs the gamut.

[06:51] You know it's used modeling as graphs, used very heavily in
natural sciences, also in the social sciences for things like network
analysis, also, in particular, the digital humanities. I think that
might be an interesting place to start because you've been teaching
several workshops in another context where you teach people to apply
graphs to what are classical humanities problems.

**Suellen**:  [07:19] Yes. We have used graphs to analyze things. An
example of one that we did was we took a corpus of letters from Flannery
O'Connor that we have at the library. Then we reached out to some other
libraries to get some metadata about the letters that they have.

[07:42] Then we were able to encode that and create some other
relationships between the dates and the subjects, and who she wrote to,
and things like that. By creating that particular graph, we were then
able to ask questions of it that would have been much harder without
that particular way of going about it.

**Cliff**:  [08:07] Tell me a little bit about the tools that you're
using to do this kind of encoding as a graph.

**Suellen**:  [08:14] We have been using a tool called Neo4j, which is
a NoSQL database, which just means it stores the data in graph format
with the nodes and edges. There's several ways that you can use Neo4j.
One is as a large scale database. You can upload Excel spreadsheets into
it, then do some networks analysis on it.

[08:45] Neo4j has lots of different levels that you can work with.
It's really useful, but one of the things that we have found most useful
and where I have found most useful in teaching is something called a
GraphGist. The GraphGist was created by Neo4j to get people to be able
to try out what it means to encode information in a graph, then be able
to query it.

[09:17] It's very simple. It's very easy to work with. I found that
humanity scholars, it's very intuitive to them. They can understand and
that a lot of the problems that they're interested in or want to
research, lend themselves well to graph format. Then on top of that,
they don't need a programmer to begin to work with this tool. It's
really helpful in a lot of different ways.

**Cliff**:  [09:46] One of the things that's really interesting about
Neo4j is the query language, Cypher. What's nice about Cypher is that
uses a visual programming style. Based on ASCII art syntax, you model a
node with two parens surrounding the node. A relationship looks like a
dash with a caret pointing to the right.

[10:12] One of the things that's nice when you're teaching humanists
who may never have programmed before is that the syntax is very
intuitive and they seem to grasp it very quickly.

**Suellen**:  [10:24] It's actually fun to work with. I've had a lot
of people say they really actually enjoy doing that kind of coding
because like you say, it's very intuitive, and it's visual, and it's
just really interesting.

**Cliff**:  [10:40] Can you tell us about some of the other Neo4j
products that you've worked on?

**Suellen**:  [10:44] I've done a little bit working with some short
stories. Two short stories come to mind. One was a Flannery O'Connor
short story called, "The Life You Save May Be Your Own."

[10:58] I also published an article that used a graph to illustrate
some points about a Vladimir Nabokov short story called, "The Vane
Sisters," and it was the type of thing that lent itself very well to a
graph because it operates on several levels.

[11:19] I was able to use the graph to point to some outside
references or resources that it was fairly clear that Nabokov used to
illuminate the story. The graph allowed me to do things that I wouldn't
have been able to do as easily with expository writing.

**Cliff**:  [11:41] I think the Nabokov example is particularly
interesting because as I understand from you, his stories, at least some
of them, are not self‑contained. They actually make references to things
in the external world that are very useful to shed light on what he's
talking about.

[11:58] Being able to model his stories as a graph, and be able to
point beyond the story and then reach back into it is actually an
important form of literary analysis for Nabokov.

**Suellen**:  [12:07] Very, very true. Yes.

**Cliff**:  [12:10] What are some of the hardest things for humanity
students coming to grasp for the first time? Where do you seem them
having the hardest time?

**Suellen**:  [12:17] I think the hardest time for them is getting
over the idea that they can't code, or that they're not coders, or
they're not programmers, or that's not just their thing. Once they get
past that, they seem to be able to very easily do the data modeling
which is necessary because that's just the way they're used to thinking
about things.

[12:43] It's a lot like those brainstorming bubbles when you're trying
to decide what you want to write a paper about, or whatever. You just
draw a bunch of circles and then connections between those and when you
get done with it you go, "Aha! I know what I wanna write."

[13:00] The process is very similar when you're doing data modeling
for use with graph analysis. That part is not a problem. The only real
problem is the idea that, "I don't know how to do this, this huge, steep
learning curve." I think once they get over the fear of it, they really
take to it pretty easily.

**Cliff**:  [13:24] We should also mention that you regularly teach
workshops. You'll be teaching a workshop in the fall on Neo4j and
probably, likely at our THATCamp. You've also recently published an
article on the library website about getting started with Neo4j.

**Suellen**:  [13:39] Yes, I put up a little tutorial. It's under our
workshops and I think it's called, "Getting Started with GraphGists."
I'll walk you through the steps that you need to take in order to get
one going.

[13:55] That one we used ancient deities or Greek gods, ancient gods.
You can see there's a lot of different applications for using graphs in
the humanities from literature to history to all different applications.

**Cliff**:  [14:21] I think there's room, the article that you
mentioned about Nabokov, I believe that you wrote that as a GraphGist. I
think that there's room for humanities students to begin exploring
writing articles in his style where they mix graph code along with their
narrative expository text.

**Suellen**:  [14:40] There's a lot of different applications for it,
you can publish, and then another useful thing is, just to collect your
research, because I think we all know, any of us who's done humanities
research, end up with a lot of post‑it sticky notes throughout your
books and graph pads full of notes.

[15:02] You're always paging back through to try to figure out, "Where
did this come from?" If you take the time to encode that into a graph,
then you could use it to help structure your research. It could be
useful just as a research tool, as well.

**Cliff**:  [15:24] This is terrific Suellen. I really appreciate
you're taking the time to talk about this. We're asking all of our guest
to...since we're all talking about digital experts, we thought it'd be
interesting to ask what is your favorite analog education technology?

**Suellen**:  [15:42] Being a librarian, of course, I love books. I'm
the first person to really like to get off the computer and be able to
touch the pages, going to walk away from anything that's plugged in or
connected and go sit outside, listen to the birds, and read that way.

**Cliff**:  [16:11] Suellen, thank you so much for this conversation.
I think it's really interesting to hear what you're doing with graphs
and how you're teaching students to think about their subjects with new
digital spectacles on.

**Suellen**:  [16:26] Thanks, Cliff, I've really enjoyed talking about
them. As you can see, I'm really...maybe I wouldn't go so far to say
passionate, but I really do like working with graphs. They're really
fun, interesting, lots of different uses, and I like getting people
excited about them.

**Cliff**:  [16:45] OK, we'll talk again soon, I hope. Thanks a lot,
bye.

**Suellen**:  [16:48] Bye.

[16:49] [music]

**Cliff**:  [16:52] Hi Michael, this is Cliff Anderson calling, and
we're really glad to have you as a guest on our podcast. We're really
excited to talk about Neo4j and its uses in educational technology.
Maybe we could start by having you introduce yourself and just tell us a
little bit about your role at the company?

[17:12] Michael Hunger: Yeah, Cliff, happy to be on your show. I'm
really excited to talk to you. I've been with Neo4j and Neo Technology
Company for a while. I joined in 2010 when we were still 10 people and
now it's been growing to almost 120.

[17:30] In all this time, I've had a lot of different roles but mostly
I'm taking care of people using Neo4j. I'm calling myself caretaker
general of the Neo4j community, which describes nicely that I'm using my
time to help people be happy and successful with Neo4j, and doing it
with a lot of different means, from articles, and blog posts, and books,
to conference talks, and meetups, events, one‑to‑ones, hands‑on support
on the convention floor, and other places.

[18:04] Also giving people ideas. I'm really good at creating tons of
ideas and then just spreading them out, and exciting people for what's
possible with this kind of technology. In general, I'm jack of all
trades at a company, doing a lot of connecting of people inside and
outside of the company.

[18:23] I think that's very important. If you have such a big field as
information technology, you bring the right people together, because I
think between interested parties that really great projects emerge.

**Cliff**:  [18:41] Maybe you could give us your elevator pitch for
what is Neo4j, for those who haven't heard about it yet.

[18:48] **Michael**: Yeah, I'll do that. Neo4j is a database. Like other
databases as well, it's meant to manage, and store, and process data,
and make it possible to create this data. But unlike other databases, it
focuses on connected information.

[19:05] As you probably know, there is no such thing as disconnected
information in the real world. Everything is connected with everything
else, more or less. Many other databases are not really good at handling
this connectiveness of data.

[19:18] Neo4j was built from the ground to do this in a really
efficient manner, to store, handle, and make the data available quickly
and efficiently, as soon as it has a lot of connections.

[19:32] If you had experienced a lot of problems in other databases,
for instance, to get really differently structured data into the
database and then quickly out again, especially if you have queries or
questions that involves joining together many, many tables, then Neo4j
could be a tool for you.

[19:50] In general, also the model that Neo4j employs, the graph
model, which is connected entities, so entities connected by
relationships, is such a suitable and versatile model that you can use
it for almost any kind of domain.

[20:07] From things like cancer research, to managing curriculums, to
recommendation engines, to routing, to even something like logistics and
package management, and many, many others as well. It's actually not
limited by the technology, rather by your imagination and the problems
that you want to solve.

**Cliff**: [20:33] One of the things I love about the way that Neo4j
talks about data modeling is that it can capture your whiteboard
sketches, so that when you're thinking about a domain and you start
putting up circles and drawing arrows, more or less you can take that
model and encode it directly in Neo4j.

**Michael**: [20:49]  Yeah, that's true. This whiteboard friendliness is a
really big advantage of the technology, because with other databases you
have the problem that, at a certain point, only developers can work with
the database and handle the data.

[21:04] But what we try to do is to keep everyone who's involved in
the project in the loop all the time, from people that come from the
business side to people that are users. Because this whiteboard model is
so natural to humans, we start to doodle on whiteboards or blackboards
as soon as we discuss any kind of topic. It's really nice to see that
people can always get along.

[21:27] Even if the data is stored in a transactional database, like
Neo4j, they still see the circles and arrows all the time and can reason
about it, and can spot issues, or find new connections, and so on.

[21:43] The other thing that we also try to do is not just do it on
the whiteboard level and on the visualization level, but also with our
query language, which is Cypher. We try to take this whiteboard model,
and the patterns that you draw on whiteboard, and turn them into a
textual queer language.

[22:00] What we did there is actually to use ASCII art to represent
these two‑dimensional drawings in a one‑dimensional text that looks
quite pretty well. What we do is we surround entities, or nodes, how we
call them, in round parenthesis, so they form a circle, visually.

[22:20] Then use something like dash, dash, greater than, or dash,
dash, less than to indicate the arrows. You can, easily, if you look at
a query in Cypher, still see the original patterns that you were looking
at or talking about.

[22:37] For instance, if you're asking for an author who also the book
which had characters appearing in the book, which enveloped certain
things, for instance. You have this kind of pattern that you would
usually draw on the whiteboard.

[22:51] You more or less draw it in text. Because that's so visual and
also efficient, some people even say it's more expressive than English
in declaring these connected patterns of information, that you then let
the database figure out how to get them quickly back to you, and
aggregate, and project information that you collect while searching for
these patterns in the data.

**Cliff**:  [23:20] You described Cypher, which I think is one of the
real joys of Neo4j. I think you've done a wonderful job of developing
that language. We've had the experience here at Vanderbilt of using
Cypher in workshops, and in the classroom, and on student projects, and
one of the things we find is that, as you say, students really take to
it.

[23:41] Because it does have a visual component that models the types
of graphs they're building. The other thing that you've done that I
think has been terrific for a teaching tool is this concept of a
GraphGist. Do you want to say a little bit about what GraphGists are?

**Michael**: [23:59] Yeah, definitely. I'd like to. In general, I think
Neo4j, or the people at Neo4j, from the very beginning spent a lot of
time and effort on documentation, making it as easy as possible for
people to get started with Neo4j, but also to have documentation about
common graph models or typical patterns that you use the graph for.

[24:23] When you are looking into that to bring it to a broader
audience, it actually turned out that with Cypher, they have the ability
to take regular text files, so you have headers, you have prose, you
have images, you have tables.

[24:41] You can intersperse that with code sections that either create
data or query data. Then we can take one of these text files, which is
just a regular text file that you can store on your computer, on
Dropbox, in a version control like GitHub, and so on.

[24:58] Then to take this text file, extract the statements, run them
against a temporary Neo4j database, and then render the graph
visualizations or the table results that come back from these queries.
You have a live document that represents your ideas that you've
described in prose, or formulas, or other visuals.

[25:23] Within that document you have exactly the same queries that
create the graph data and create the graph, too, so that you have a live
document of what you want to do and then, also, demonstrating how you
want to do that.

[25:35] Over the years, we had several challenges for people to
produce these GraphGists, and also a lot of people actually creating
them on their own. In total, we have now a collection of, I think,
almost 300 of them across a lot of different categories, from things
like humanities, to healthcare, to logistics, to recommendations, to
storytelling.

[26:01] If you want to see some of them, you can go to
Neo4j.com/GraphGist. You can find a rich collection of these really
interesting documents. As an author, you can also run this locally, so
if you want to keep your data inside your company, then you can also
say, "OK, I'll just run this locally."

[26:23] The use for students is actually quite interesting, because
I'm also doing classroom lectures sometimes, either directly or
remotely, and I even use GraphGist as homework assignments for students.

[26:36] In the lecture they learn about graphs, and Neo4j, and Cypher,
and then they give them GraphGist template that they can then put in a
model that they like, either something that they are interested in, a
hobby, or a project they've been working on, and create a little bit of
data, write one or two queries, and then hand this in as a homework
assignment to the professor.

[27:01] So far, the professors and the students that we did it
actually liked the idea and we got some really interesting content out
of that. Because if people get started once and they really care about
the subject, then they go to very great lengths and that's to create
something that's truly, truly amazing.

[27:21] Plus, it's always astounding, the variety of things that
people use Neo4j and the graph model for, so it's a really exciting time
to use. Every day you learn something new, how someone used this
technology. That makes it really a lot of fun to look for, to people in
the Neo4j community as well.

**Cliff**: [27:43] We'll put the link to the GraphGists in our show
notes, but it is really a wonderful collection, especially if you're
thinking about a domain that you might like to model to see how others
have done it. I love the idea of using it for homework. We'll have to
try that here.

[27:58] One of the other things that you've done that I think has been
really great for helping people to get started is that you've built in a
visualization engine into Neo4j, so that it's not just coming out as
tabular data but it also got a graphical representation from your
queries.

**Michael**: [28:17] Yeah, that's true. I think that ties to what I said
before, that you want to keep this rich, whiteboard visualization off
your domain. Not just on the whiteboard and in the query language, but
also in the output that you get back from your database.

[28:31] As in the database, the data is stored as nodes and
relationships anyway. Putting them on the screen again is just a little
step but very, very useful, because many people have to take this visual
cue and have a much easier time to work with the data if they can see
it.

[28:51] Even if you can't visualize the whole graph, because many
graphs go into the billions of nodes if you have real‑world production
data, but you can always visualize a sample or a small part of that and
explain something.

[29:08] Also navigate visually, you can double‑click on nodes and then
they expand with their neighborhood and so on. I think this aspect is
really important, and many other tools in the library that people also
use to integrate these kinds of visualizations into their own projects,
which makes it really easy for them to also have within their own
application, a graph visualization that allows them to bring home the
richness of the domain.

[29:40] Which is, if you put it in table it's just lost. Because in
tables you just have columns and numbers and you actually don't see the
forest for the trees anymore. I think the graph visualization is really
an important aspect, as you said, to make the data accessible again for
people.

**Cliff**:  [29:58] If you were to come here to Vanderbilt, you'd see
that we've actually put several on display in our exhibits. The students
who have worked on these have been very proud of the visualizations
they've produced.

[30:10] Again, I think one of the things is it's open, you can add
something like D3.js to do more complicated visualizations, but you've
made it very easy for people without a programming background to get
started. Then when they need to scale up and do something different,
they can do that.

**Michael**: [30:27] Yeah, that's true. You've probably heard of the
Panama Papers investigation this year? The ICIJ, the Investigative
Journalists Consortium, also use Neo4j as the underlying technology to
connect all the different bits and pieces of information.

[30:44] For them, they had quoted, "It's like magic." Put it in there
and suddenly its available as a connected network of information that
you can see and you can see connections between people and events and
companies and so on.

[31:00] As soon as you start to add new connections then new patterns
emerge and you have for instance, two or three of the four hundred
journalists that look on the data. Add new connections and suddenly a
new story emerges for a third journalist.

[31:15] Having this available for everyone is really powerful because
then you cannot just take the typical business applications but you can
also do so much more. There are projects like
[the-codex.net](http://the-codex.net/), which uses renaissance letters
from da Vinci and Michelangelo from Italy to draw a full picture of
timeline and places and events out of the renaissance.

[31:47] Or if you take out of data sources like information about
authors, like the work of an author, or if you take full libraries for
instance and cross reference to the works in the library, then I think
all this information is so much more accessible as it is in an index or
in a tabular database, I think.

**Cliff**:  [32:12] I think it's wonderful that you've also made that
available as a darker image so that people who want to explore that data
easily can get started really quickly. I was at a meet‑up in San
Francisco where they were helping people hands on to get that darker
image up and running.

[32:33] You've done a great job packaging this so that people can
easily get started with queries and exploring without a lot of
preliminary set‑up. Again, thanks Michael for talking with us, and as we
ask all our guests, what would you consider your favorite analog
technology?

**Michael**: [32:51] That's an interesting question. I'm a big fan of da
Vinci. Actually, he has a lot of really good exhibition just a few weeks
back and I think looking at all the things he invented and built, just
the simple mechanics, I think that's my favorite technology.

[33:10] From his flying machines to all the levers and pulls, all the
things that made work so much easier for people, I think that's the
thing that I really like most, to see what's possible if you're just
smart about things and not just use brute force.

**Cliff**: [33:34] That's a wonderful answer. I love those notebooks
too. We really appreciate the time you've taken with us and we really
appreciate everything that you've done at Neo4j to help students get
started with thinking about graphs and data bases. We look forward to
seeing exciting things to come. Thanks so much again.

**Michael**: [33:55] For everyone who is able to, I invite everyone to
come to our conference in San Francisco to just connect. It's on October
13th.

**Cliff**:  [34:05] Awesome. Thank you so much. Thanks again Michael,
I really appreciate it.

**Michael**: [34:09] Thank you.

**Cliff**:  [34:10] Bye‑bye.

**Derek**:  [34:10] That was Michael Hunger of Neo Technology, and
earlier, Suellen Stringer‑Hye, a librarian here at Vanderbilt
University. You can read more about both of our guests by following the
link in the show notes which include a link to the "Getting started with
GraphGists" tutorial that Suellen mentioned.

[34:27] Thanks to Cliff Anderson, director of Scholarly Communications
at the Vanderbilt University library, for those interviews.

[34:33] You've been listening to Leading Lines, a podcast on
educational technology from Vanderbilt University. That podcast is
produced by the Center For Teaching, The Vanderbilt Institute for
Digital Learning, the office at Scholarly Communications, and the
Associate Provost For Digital Learning.

[34:46] You can find past episodes on our website,
leadinglinespod.com, and you can follow us on Twitter where our handle
is @leadinglinespod. Look for new episodes the first and third Monday of
each month.

[34:58] I'm your host, Derek Bruff. Thanks for listening.
