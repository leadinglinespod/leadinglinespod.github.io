In this episode, we feature two interviews conducted by Cliff Anderson, the Director of Scholarly Communications at the Vanderbilt library.  Both interviews focus on Neo4j, an open source platform that can be used to visualize and analyze data and connections among data.

Cliff interviews his Vanderbilt library colleague Suellen Stringer-Hye, Linked Data and Semantic Web Coordinator.  Suellen has worked with a number of faculty members and students here at Vanderbilt, helping them use Neo4j in their research.  In the interview, she talks about some of those projects and how a database tool like Neo4j can be easier to use than one might think.

In the second interview, Cliff interviews Michael Hunger, who handles developer relations for Neo Technology, the company that has developed Neo4j.  Michael shares a few more examples of how Neo4j has been used and how it supports collaborative data visualization and analysis.
