In this episode, Vanderbiltâ€™s Associate Provost for Digital Learning John Sloop interviews Jan Holmevik, Associate Professor of English and Co-director of the Center of Excellence in Next-Generation Computing and Creativity at  Clemson University. Holmevik was central in working to give the nearly 30,000 students and faculty at Clemson access to all the software tools in the Adobe Creative Cloud, along with an impressive "collaboration space" filled with high-end hardware, collaboration tools, and expert guidance. Among a wide array of essays and books, Holmevik is the author of "Inside Innovation: The History of the SIMULA Programming Languages," "MOOniversity: A Students Guide to Online Learning Environments," and "Inter/vention: Free Play in the Age of Electracy."

In the interview, Holmevik talks about what it took to launch this project, both in terms of strategic leadership and faculty development and support, as well as the roles digital literacy has played in higher education in the past.
