In this episode, Vanderbilt’s Associate Provost for Digital Learning John Sloop interviews Jan Holmevik, Associate Professor of English and Co-director of the Center of Excellence in Next-Generation Computing and Creativity at  Clemson University. Holmevik was central in working to give the nearly 30,000 students and faculty at Clemson access to all the software tools in the Adobe Creative Cloud, along with an impressive "collaboration space" filled with high-end hardware, collaboration tools, and expert guidance. Among a wide array of essays and books, Holmevik is the author of "Inside Innovation: The History of the SIMULA Programming Languages," "MOOniversity: A Students Guide to Online Learning Environments," and "Inter/vention: Free Play in the Age of Electracy."

In the interview, Holmevik talks about what it took to launch this project, both in terms of strategic leadership and faculty development and support, as well as the roles digital literacy has played in higher education in the past.

## Episode 16: Jan Holmevik

[00:00] [background music]

**Derek Bruff**: [00:00] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching.

[00:03] In this podcast, we explore creative, intentional and
effective uses of technology to enhance student learning, uses that
point the way to the future of educational technology in college and
university settings.

[00:21] In this episode, Vanderbilt's associate provost for digital
learning, John Sloop, interviews Jan Holmevik, associate professor of
English at Clemson University, and co‑director of Clemson's Center of
Excellence in Next Generation Computing and Creativity.

[00:35] Holmevik was instrumental in a recent effort at Clemson
University to provide all its students and faculty with access to
Adobe's Creative Cloud Suite, a photography design video and web apps.
Just imagine, a campus license to Photoshop, Premier, Illustrator and
more.

[00:51] In the interview, Holmevik talks about what it took to launch
this project, both in terms of strategic leadership and faculty
development and support, but the interview begins with something of a
look back at the roles digital literacy has played in higher education
in the past.

[01:06] [background music]

**John Sloop**: [01:06] Hi, this is John Sloop. I'm sitting with Jan
Holmevik. He's an associate professor of Professional Communication in
Rhetoric at Clemson University. We're sitting in the lobby of the
Marriott in San Diego. We're out here for the Adobe Conference, which is
relevant to what I want to talk to Jan about today.

[01:30] A couple of things. Jan Holmevik has been writing about online
education, online learning environments, since back in the '90s, so way
before many people were thinking about this. I'm talking to Jan today
about something very innovative he's been in charge of recently at
Clemson.

[01:53] I'll let him describe this in a second, but Jan brought to
Clemson or helped cultivate at Clemson bringing in cyber licenses for
all the students and faculty for Adobe's Creative Campus with all of
their programs.

[02:06] He's going to talk about that in just a second, what they're
trying to do there, what the problems might be, what are the hiccups,
etc., but it's an innovative project and one that's being emulated by
other universities.

[02:20] Jan, I want to welcome you here to Leading Lines podcast.

**Jan Holmevik**: [02:24] Thank you.

**John**: [02:24] Appreciate you taking time.

[02:26] Before we get to Adobe, could you talk to me a little bit
about, you've done all sorts of research in game design, game culture,
and digital literacy? You've been doing this for quite a long time now.
Talk to me a little bit about how you got into this, where your
interests were, and then what you've seen change over time.

[02:45] If you look back in some of your earlier writings, what do you
think you got right or wrong? I don't know if those are the right words
for it, but how do you see if such has changed?

**Jan**: [02:57] First of all, thanks for having me. I sure
appreciate it.

[02:57] Yes, as you say, I've been at it for a while since back in the
mid '90s. I got involved with online learning environments through my
interest in technology, specifically gaming technology.

[03:18] As I was growing up, I was fortunate enough have a Commodore
64 computer. That set me on a path that leads actually up to this very
day. The idea that games could be more than fun and games, so to speak,
has always been intriguing to me. What can you learn when you approach
the process of learning by playing? What is the role of play in the
larger project of learning?

**John**: [03:56] Wait. Were you thinking this while you were
playing?

**Jan**: [04:00] I saw a very early disconnect between the way that I
was taught in school and the way that I learned when I was playing
games. This lack of understandings of the exploratory process with
learning that it was all an academic intellectual exercise and that
play, and experimentation, and failure indeed was something that was
frowned upon, basically.

[04:30] I realized that that was something that...It was not right. It
didn't feel right to me. It has never felt right to me. I've always
tried to find ways to prove that there is a place for play, and games,
and learning.

[04:51] In the mid '90s, I came across a system that Amy Bruckman at
MIT, and she's now a professor at Georgia Tech. She was a graduate
student at MIT at the time. She had taken a multi‑user online game,
basically, that was developed by researchers at Xerox PARC. It's called
a MOO. I got involved with that.

[05:16] I started experimenting with this technology in the classroom.
Have you bring students into an environment that is inherently playful
and then have them turn that into learning experiences?

[05:28] Specifically, with regard to writing, I found the Computers
and Writing group in the US. Sandy, Selfe, and Gail Hawisher's excellent
work in the '80s and into the '90s formed this community of scholars and
graduate students who are interested in these kinds of things.

[05:58] That became my audience. Working in the '90s, I wrote two
books with Cynthia Haynes on how to set up and how to manage and how to
use these kinds of environments for learning.

**John**: [06:19] I just want to what say something now, market, and
see if this was true in your experience, because it'll be relevant to
some of what I want to ask you about when we get to Adobe.

[06:30] My sense was in the late '90s, when I was teaching ‑‑ I was
teaching media ecology courses ‑‑ I wasn't doing MOOs or anything like
that. I was out in front of my students in so many ways, because their
digital literacy was so embryonic at that point so that I could easily
be teaching them things, in a way that now, the game's very, very
different.

[06:58] Was that your experience then that you were leading the way
with some of your students?

**Jan**: [07:02] Part of it is that the Internet was not universally
available then as it is now. The people who were in the know, so to
speak, were on the real Internet, and everybody else was on AOL, which
was a bulletin board with a limited set of functions.

[07:25] You had that division. A lot of students who came into the
university at that time had not had that opportunity yet to experience
the real possibility of the Internet, with all of the
telecommunications, capabilities, and file sharing, and websites,
eventually.

[07:44] There was that, and of course a lot of them came in, had not
had computers at home and did not...coming to school was their first
meeting with computers. In other words, they were not digitally native
as students are today.

[07:55] In a sense, it was a different time. To me, it was a question
of, what do we do with these new opportunities? That's always been my
driving principle, is, what's next? Where do we go next? How do we take
advantage of what we have now to improve what we're doing now and into
the future?

[08:30] When these multi‑user games came along, and we started
thinking about, "Well, how can those be used for education? What do you
gain if you put people together online and encourage collaboration and
learning?"

[08:51] For instance, one of the projects we developed with a group of
researchers at Trinity College in Dublin and also University of in
Bergen in Norway was foreign language learning acquisition.

[09:03] We would facilitate what was called tandem learning, where you
had a German student wanting to learn English and an English student
wanting to learn German, and we put them together and they had a
structured learning process.

[09:18] They also had this informal communication in which they would
help each other out. We tried to simulate what it's like to go and learn
in a foreign country. Learning your language from a native speaker as
opposed to somebody who's not a native speaker, because there are a lot
of nuances that you can't pick up if you're not a native speaker, unless
you're really fluent, and students at that level were typically not that
fluent.

[09:47] Those projects we had in '97, '98. My dissertation grew out of
that and I designed this online learning environment called Lingual MOO
with a web‑based component to it. At the time, I didn't know it, but
basically today we'd call it was a web application. It ran in the web
browser. It had a chat function, it had plugin capability for video and
audio.

[10:24] It was a fairly rich environment that also, and this is
important, enabled and encouraged social construction, that is,
participation by the users.

**John**: [10:43] Again I [inaudible] if you were looking back at
what you thought then, what was going to happen with the Internet, with
online communities, clearly out in front of others, how's it been
different than you expected? What's been different? What hopes were not
realized, because there was a lot of heavy utopianism back in those days
[inaudible] ?

**Jan**: [11:03] Things had taken much longer than I had thought. As
you get older, 20 years all of a sudden takes on [laughs] a different
kind of perspective, right?

**John**: [11:14] Certainly does.

**Jan**: [11:16] I had actually thought that we would be further
along the road to incorporating digital technologies in a deep and
systematic way that not only aids as a tool, but is an enabler on a much
deeper, fundamental level. I really had thought that the World Wide Web,
and the digital world would eclipse the print world much faster.

[11:47] It has not, but partly is because we didn't have the platform
until the smartphone platform and the tablet platform. Even now, the
smartphone platform, if you go buy Apple iOS, and the iPhone, 10 years
old next year, things are still very much the way that they were.

[12:13] If there's been a disappointment for me, it's that the world
isn't moving as fast as I would like it to, even though I'm doing my
darnedest to make it go faster. I guess that's the biggest thing.

[12:34] Of course, there are a lot of things that seemed like a good
idea at the time, that in hindsight may not have been such a great idea.
This is a newer idea, but the whole idea of the MOOC and massively open
courses that are developed once and taught a million times.

[13:00] I've never really bought into that, I really think that there
needs to be this personal connection. More so when the technologies are
sitting between the instructor and the student, if the students don't
feel like they're part of a learning situation that is dynamic, they can
reach out and they can ask for help, or they can get input when they
need it. I think that's problematic.

[13:30] At the same token, I think the technologies that make
something like a MOOC possible also make almost one‑on‑one instruction
along the lines of the old traditional wizard and the apprentice
possible, where you can make those connections. The MOOC is of course
newer than what we were talking about back in the '90s.

**John**: [14:03] You gave me a good way to transition to our
discussion of what you've done at Clemson, or what you're doing, I
should say, because this is an ongoing project with Adobe. When you said
things are not moved as quickly as you expected. I think this is an
example of you moving things forward.

[14:20] I'm going to let you talk about the project, but I want you to
talk about it with the full knowledge that other universities are
looking at you as a model of where we might go. Something you said was,
you thought we would move faster, I think it's interesting.

[14:36] What you're doing with Adobe is taking digital literacy
seriously, when most universities, and, God bless, writing is still
very, very important, I don't want to ever say it, sounds like I'm not
saying that, have invested so much in writing. In an old fashioned
technology writing as the skill set to teach.

[14:58] You're looking and saying, "Yes, but there's more, there's
change taking place, students need to be, not just literate, but
digitally literate." You found tools, or a way to make that happen, or a
way at least to get you moving. Can you talk a little bit about that,
your partnership with Adobe, how this happened, what you're trying to
do?

**Jan**: [15:20] We at Clemson, and I'm sure, Vanderbilt and other
universities, people have been teaching with Adobe tools for a long
time. Up until recently, Adobe had their software distributed as
packages. You bought a license, you installed it, then you had it.

[15:39] This made it easy for us to get it installed in lab machines
and so on, and typically the programs that would get it, because it was
expensive obviously, would be journalism, graphic design, art,
communication of various kinds.

[15:59] We had our professional communications program that we taught
this to our students. Back when Adobe changed to the Creative Cloud,
2011 and 2012, everything was up in the air.

[16:15] We didn't know now, they changed from a model where you buy a
package and install it on a computer, to a model where you have an
individual license. Not to a computer, but to a person. We started
worrying about what this is going to mean for our ability to continue to
teach these tools.

[16:40] At the same time, I also thought that this is an opportunity
to really go to the next level with this, and really bring it to the
students in a whole new way that we haven't had the opportunity to
before because now it would be tied to them and their trajectory, as
opposed to a program's capability.

[17:10] In 2011 and 2012, as Adobe moved to the cloud, we were
concerned about the fact that our old ways of deploying their software
was no longer going to be workable.

[17:22] We got in touch with out CIO, Jim Bottum. Instructional
Technologies was under CIO's office area at that time. He will tell you
that he thought Adobe was just about PDFs, and he didn't really want to
sit down and talk about PDFs. He had bigger fish to fry.

[17:47] The folks from Adobe had tried to get in his door several
times during that 2013, without really any success. They started hearing
from us, the professors who wanted to find the right solution to this
Creative Cloud problem that we foresaw.

[18:10] He was hearing from Adobe. They wanted in and tell him about
Creative Cloud. He was hearing from the faculty saying, "We need to
figure out what we're going to do with Creative Cloud."

[18:21] He said, "OK. Let's talk." We got together, Jonathan Hammond
came into campus with a group. Jonathan loves white‑boarding session, so
he did a big white‑boarding session about extoling the virtues of
Creative Cloud.

[18:39] I remember after it was done, I just looked across the table.
I said, "That was nice. Now let's get down to business." I said, "How
can we do this?" You don't need to sell us on this thing.

[18:49] Within English, within Computers and Writing, there is a
rhetorics for 20 years and more, going out of...was saying Sandy, Selfe,
and Gail Hawisher in the Computers and Writing groups, there has been
this awareness of these technologies, and willingness to experiment and
use.

[19:11] I told him, "We're ready. We're here. We're onboard. You don't
need to sell us on this. What we need to figure out is how we're going
to make this affordable?" We're a state institution. We have about
20,000 undergrads. We have 5,000 graduates, and they were at the time
charging \$19.95‑a‑month per student. You can do the math and you'll see
that doesn't add up.

**John**: [19:36] No.

**Jan**: [19:36] We're saying, "We need to find a way to make this
affordable enough." In fact, we also want to find a way to give it to
everybody because at this point, people were, now, starting to talking
about the new generation of not just consumers of knowledge but makers
of knowledge.

[19:52] We're looking at learners as both, and the fact that by
producing, you're also learning.

[19:58] You have to now be thinking about enabling production, in
addition to just consumption of knowledge. We, like I said, sat down
with them.

[20:13] Jim Bottum was integral part of all of this process. We
negotiated a contract with Adobe that in 2014, became the first all‑in
contract basically, offering up Adobe Creative Cloud to everybody at the
university.

[20:31] For me, that was a huge step in the right direction because,
A, we had solved the licensing problem. We also now have a baseline for
the technologies that our students will have. As a professor, you can
now say you will be using Premier Pro and you'll be using InDesign.

[20:52] You'll be using Photoshop, whereas before, if you wanted to
teach with intra‑technologies you had to have two or three plans. For
Mac users, for Windows users, and then you have people who come in with
an old laptop that needs pumps and [inaudible] . Excuse me, a laptop
requirement, but it doesn't really say you have to have a minimum
config.

[21:18] Lots of people come in with an old laptop that can't run this
type of state‑of‑the‑art stuff anymore. They have to go to a lab
analysis.

[21:28] For a lot of instructors, that was a deterrent because it's
just so troublesome to get this done. It's much easier to have students
read out of a book and then discuss what they read and then write a
paper about it afterwards.

[21:44] We were able to make it easy for the students to get access to
the technology. We were able to make it easy for instructors to know
what they can plan on students having.

[22:00] We also moved from having to provide labs basis for these
things, to now students having the laptop. Now, they have the software
on their own laptop and now in later revisions, on their mobile devices
as well.

[22:15] That was a super‑exciting development, and that was negotiated
in the fall of 2013. We finalized the agreement in March 2014.

**John**: [22:27] You said something and I want you to speak about
that I think university is going to have to face. While it is true that
Adobe then, you've made it accessible to all the students, one of the
things most universities have is that we already have a setup for
supporting writing. We have setups for supporting all this.

[22:48] It's not just a matter of a teacher saying, "You don't have
Adobe, so it's going to be hard for me to assign it." Now they do.

[22:56] A teacher, an instructor, a professional might still say, "But
the university has these tools to help me support writing, which I may
or may not be an expert in, but do they have tools to support Adobe,
which I may or may not be expert as an instructor?" How do you solve
that support problem?

**Jan**: [23:13] In my talk here at the [inaudible] yesterday, I
went through some of the things that we had done at Clemson to do that
because we realize that you can't rely on build‑it and they will come.
In other words, just deploying the software, giving students the
software, giving people the software, is not going to be enough.

[23:34] I think you're right. I think institutions who are looking to
go into digital literacy with this kind of heavy involvement and
investment need to be thinking about software as part of that equation.
The other elements of the equation will be showing in an outreach on the
ground and most universities already have training, and training
programs.

[23:57] They have trainers. Those trainers may need to be realigned,
and that's what we did at Clemson. All of the trainers are now working
on. Whereas before, we had one Adobe trainer, now all of our trainers
can do Adobe support and training.

[24:15] We created a Center of Excellence for this. What that does is
it helps identify opportunities and then support those opportunities,
whether it is faculty or departments who are interested in getting into
this in a more in‑depth way.

**John**: [24:35] This is Center of Excellence?

**Jan**: [24:38] Yes.

**John**: [24:38] Is this separate from the Center for Teaching and
specifically about...?

**Jan**: [24:43] Right. Our Center of Excellence is tri‑factor, if
you will, but it has next gen computing. It has GIS and it has
creativity. You may wonder what did those three have in common, and
nothing other than the fact that the three of us who are running or
those of us who are involved in it, were seen as doing interesting and
forward‑thinking work.

[25:08] Our CIO thought it would be interesting to see what if you put
these folks together in a Center of Excellence and let that influence
and unfold?

[25:25] It has been a really interesting experience. For the
creativity side of things, what we're seeing is, we can identify
individual professors who we can help become Centers of Excellence, who
can then influence their colleagues.

[25:39] I try to remind people of this every time I talk about this
is, traditional literacy has taken over 2,000 years to develop. The kind
of digital literacy we're talking about here, we can't have a short‑term
perspective on this.

[25:56] Hopefully, less than 2,000 years, but certainly more than
three to six years. Certainly going back to what I said earlier, things
don't move as fast as those of us in the area would like to. The support
efforts are going to be in place for a long time to ensure the success.

**John**: [26:19] I may be asking a question that's getting back at
what you just said, but let me try to see if I can put this in a
different way. What I see as one of the hindrances to rolling out
something like the Adobe Creative Cloud across the entire campus. If
we're going to take digital literacy seriously, this is every class,
every student becomes part of it.

[26:42] There's going to be a number of instructors who feel
ill‑equipped to utilize this in the class. If they're not experts
themselves or users themselves, in a way that most professors, right or
wrong, they felt like they're good enough teachers of writing to pull
that off.

[27:01] If they don't use Adobe products, they might not feel like
they're equipped to do this. At what level of scope does the faculty
need to be to incorporate this in their class or region? Could they do
it without any facility themselves or what sort of expertise do you see
there?

**Jan**: [27:23] Creative Cloud is the top end of Adobe's offerings.
At this conference you've heard us talk a lot about the spark tools and
the mobile tools. These have lower thresholds for entry and can act as
bridges to the more professional great tools.

[27:47] I always am of the opinion that choosing the right tool for
the job is probably more than half of the job. You can start out with
doing a job and if the tool is wrong, then you're struggling with the
tool more so than the solution.

[28:03] That's what a Center of Excellence or a similar organization
can do, is help sit down with a professor and say, "What do you want to
accomplish with bringing digital tools into your teaching? What do you
already know? What do you need help with?"

[28:24] We can act as a connector between. We can then bring in
training resources from our training group. Our trainers can come in and
teach the whole class about Premier Pro, if that is the case.

[28:35] On the professors side too, I think what we, as professors,
have to start thinking about is we don't need to know everything about
everything. That is, we need to be content experts but we don't
necessarily need to be technical experts in order to bring this in.

[29:00] In most classes, you have students who already are doing this
kind of stuff. You'd be surprised. You start asking around.

[29:08] Somebody has a YouTube channel. They've been doing videos on
games for years. They're already experts in this thing. They can become
just deputized on right there and say, "Hey, you're a teaching assistant
in this course and you're going to help me do this."

[29:25] For a lot of instructors, of course, it's scary to have to
rely on the students for help. I always thought that the classroom is an
environment in which you need to be able to give and take, and students
are a resource. I have always looked at my students as resource. I
always learn so much from my students.

[29:50] I puzzles me sometimes that we're not thinking about students,
the resource that they bring to the classroom. Rather, we often tend to
think of them as empty vessels that must be filled with some knowledge
that only we possess.

[30:08] [background music]

**Derek**: [30:09] That was Jan Holmevik, associate professor of
English and Clemson University, interviewed by Vanderbilt's John Sloop.

[30:15] I have John here with me for a follow‑up to the interview.
Unfortunately, the interview itself was cut off when a session let out
at the conference where John was recording, which is one reason we don't
have our usual question about analogue technologies.

[30:34] John, you and Jan talked a little bit more about the Clemson
initiative. Did he point to any particular challenges that they run into
as they have been rolling out this Creative Cloud digital literacy work
at Clemson?

**John**: [30:45] Yeah, some of the challenges are predictable. You
have people more or less interested in working with Adobe, not just
Adobe but some professors more or less interested in working with
digital technology all together.

[30:59] The thing I found most interesting he talked about in the
interview with me but also in the session, we were talking about someone
in the audience asked "What's the bottleneck to really extending this
campus wide?"

[31:12] There's a discussion that broke out and somebody else in the
audience said, "I will assume that the bottleneck is faculty who are
older, don't know how to work with these products, have no interest in
doing so."

[31:23] Jan said, and he emphasized this to me later, and has on
several occasions now, that in fact, "The bottleneck is not only the
faculty but some students, that there's this myth that as digital
natives that all of them are adept at every product, whatever it is, and
have the same interest."

[31:41] He said, "That's quite frankly not true. There are faculty who
are interested and students who are skittish and want to stay away from
it and don't want to learn something new," etc.

[31:51] He said, "You're having to bring along," and this is only a
problem because they weren't even prepared for it. They thought the
faculty were going to be the bottleneck, so they focused all their
training efforts there and didn't think enough about this.

[32:05] They assumed the students will be willing to jump out at all
at once. They had to rethink how to make sure the students were getting
excited about it and getting the right students in the right classes
doing the right kind of work.

**Derek**: [32:16] I believe that in part because as I've seen
students, particularly when I teach my first year writing seminar, and I
have first year students, there are technologies that either they have
never used that I want them to use in my course, or they've used it just
for entertainment or social purposes.

[32:35] Maybe they have a little experience with video editing tools
or something but they haven't used those tools to create an academic
product in the past. There's often quite a learning curve for students.

**John**: [32:48] Yeah, there's quite a learning curve. I was also
thinking, and this is maybe going a little out of bounds.

[32:53] One of the things that I would like to talk to Jan about at
some point, and probably something you think about quite a lot, is even
when we have faculty and students both interested in trying some of this
out, thinking about how to assess work, that's not the normal sort of
work we assess.

[33:10] I'm generally assessing public speeches or papers. Assessing a
podcast, that's a different monster. That's basically the type of
training we also have to think about.

**Derek**: [33:22] Well, did Jan point to any successes from this
program, does it seem to be working?

**John**: [33:28] I came bringing up something in specific right now
but it's working really well, and that's evidenced by the fact that if
you talk to the representatives at Adobe, when I went to the conference
and when they've come here to talk to us, almost all of the examples
that they bring to the fore are Clemson students.

[33:48] First off, Clemson is further along than other university.
They were the first one to do a full site license. Secondly, they did it
the right way. They've gone in knowing to roll it out. They were going
to have to train people, put some resources into doing so and make sure
it works.

[34:05] There's plenty of examples. I'm sure that Jan would be happy
to show you some of those. You can also find those on Adobe's website
for this.

[34:15] I do want to emphasize this. I think this is one of the things
that Jan points to and that some of the other universities that I've
talked to, University of North Carolina is an example, that rolling this
out, rolling Adobe Creative Cloud out, and Jan says this already on it,
"You can't just say here we have a license and it's going to work. You
have to have a plan in mind."

[34:39] There're several universities that I've discovered, and I
won't mention them here, but they have full site licenses, but even the
students and faculty that I've talk to there have no idea.

[34:48] The university paid them for the resource but did not think
about how really to unroll it, and as you know in your position, that's
a whole lot of the game.

**Derek**: [34:59] Yeah, if it doesn't live in the curriculum in some
fashion, then it's just window dressing.

[35:06] If folks at other campuses wanted to find out more about what
they're doing at Clemson, what could they do?

**John**: [35:12] I was sorry, we didn't get to this in the
interview. Jan who I've only gotten to know in the last year, sees his
role at Clemson and sees Clemson's role as one of the schools to first
do this as...Evangelist might be too strong of a word.

[35:33] For Adobe, Jan will tell you, you can teach these same skills
on other types of tools although he likes having the site license or
something that use in the industry, but he sees part of his job is to
help show other schools what they've done, what the successes are and
what their headaches have been, what their labs look like, etc.

[35:51] He invites anyone who's interested to come down and take a
look at their labs to walk through. He's got something of a program
built now on doing this, so he sees folks come in.

"[36:01] We'll have lunch. We'll talk about this, this, this." He is
very collaborative, doesn't see this as a one university initiative but
as something that should be happening all over the place.

**Derek**: [36:12] That's great. As I find with teaching innovations,
if they're not made visible in intentional ways, it's actually hard for
other people to understand, "Why would I do that? What does it actually
look like?"

[36:22] The fact that he's willing to host people says a lot about how
he's thinking about spreading this work.

**John**: [36:28] It's interesting. He seems to be thinking about it
in the two prong ways. One on campus, how do you spread it? Outside of
this campus, how do you spread it?

[36:36] As educators, thinking of ourselves as not simply...We try to
break down silos in our universities but the idea of breaking them
outside too, that's a nice effort, I like that idea.

**Derek**: [36:49] Well, thanks, John. In the show notes, we'll add a
few links to some of the initiatives at Clemson. You can find those show
