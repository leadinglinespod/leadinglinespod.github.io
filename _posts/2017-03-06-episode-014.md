In this episode, we speak with Katy Börner, professor of information science at Indiana University-Bloomington. Dr. Börner is the curator of a traveling exhibit called Places and Spaces: Mapping Science. The exhibit, now in its twelfth year, features print and interactive visualizations capturing science and how science is done. Vanderbilt is hosting the exhibit this spring. Leading Lines host Derek Bruff interviewed Dr. Börner while she was on campus.
