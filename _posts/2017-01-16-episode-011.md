In this episode, we feature an interview with Kathryn Tomasek, associate professor of history at Wheaton College. Kathryn is interviewed by Cliff Anderson, Associate University Librarian for Research and Learning at Vanderbilt. Last summer, Cliff met several of Kathryn's undergraduate students at a private seminar that she held in the lead up to the 2016 Alliance of Digital Humanities Organizations conference in Krakow, Poland. Kathryn’s work focuses on transcription and mark up of historical texts, and she and her students are active in TEI, the Text Encoding Initiative. 

In the interview, Kathryn discusses her experiences getting started with text encoding, the value of teaching all students how machines talk to each other, and the role that text encoding can play in helping students engage in the kind of close reading that’s critical for historical analysis.

## Episode 11: Kathryn Tomasek

[00:00] [background music]

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:01] Welcome to season two of "Leading Lines," a
podcast from Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, Director
of the Vanderbilt Center for Teaching. We hope you enjoyed our first
season, all 10 episodes of which are available on our website
leadinglinespod.com. We're looking forward to more explorations of
creative, intentional, and effective uses of technology to enhance
student learning here in season two.

[00:28] In this episode, we feature an interview with Kathryn Tomasek,
Associate Professor of History at Wheaton College. Kathryn is
interviewed by my colleague, Cliff Anderson, Associate University
Librarian for Research and Learning here at Vanderbilt.

[00:40] Cliff met Kathryn at the 2016 Alliance of Digital and
Humanities Organizations Conference in Krakow, Poland where Kathryn
shared some of her work engaging undergraduate students in the digital
humanities.

[00:50] Kathryn's work focuses on transcription and markup of
historical of texts. She and her students are active in TEI, the Text
Encoding Initiative.

[00:59] In the interview, Kathryn discusses her experience of getting
started with text encoding, the value of teaching all students how
machines talk to each other and the role that text encoding can play in
helping students engage in close reading that's critical for historical
analysis.

[01:13] [background music]

**Cliff Anderson**:  [01:15] I am here with Kathryn Tomasek who is a
Professor at Wheaton College, Professor of History. We're going to talk
today about some of the really innovative work that she's done using
digital humanities, in particular the TEI, with undergraduates. Welcome,
Kathryn.

**Kathryn Tomasek**:  [01:31] Hi, Cliff.

**Cliff**:  [01:36] Why don't we start talking a little bit about your
own background, how you got to where you are professionally and how you
developed your interest in digital humanities?

**Kathryn**:  [01:48] I started off studying something that didn't
seem to have anything to do with digital humanities or digital history.
I would say I was trained as an analog historian. I went to grad school
at Wisconsin. I did a dissertation on women in Fourierist communities.
Fourierism was a so‑called the Utopian Movement of the 1840s. It has a
lot to do with Transcendentalism. I was interested in women's work.

[02:18] Partly as a result of that and partly because there was an
opportunity, the interest in women's work ‑‑ I guess I would say ‑‑ I
attended some workshops that were organized through [NITLE](http://www.nitle.org/) and the
Mellon Foundation in 2004, a million years ago. They were about using
text encoding in the classroom.

[02:41] We learned some texting coding and we did a pilot experiment
in a women's history class. My colleague in the archives, Zeph Stickney,
had purchased the journal of the daughter of a Baptist minister from
the period following the US Civil War. We used it in a US women's
history class to give students an opportunity to encounter a primary
source.

[03:21] We had them do some transcription and then we had them do some
markup. The students loved it. They felt like they got to know Maria
Wood, and to really care about her life. They really wanted to know what
happened in her life after the period of the journal, which I consider
to be a real success because people from the past always seem to be
fairly distant and not real people, or they can't seem that way. This
gave students an opportunity to identify with someone and get to know
her and care about her.

**Cliff**:  [04:01] Obviously, that forces a close reading of the text
that students who probably don't have coming into college, don't
necessarily have a background in that close reading.

[04:18] Maybe you can explain just a little bit for those who maybe
listen to this and come into educational technologies from different
perspectives, a little bit about what the TEI is and how that plays a
role in textual editing.

**Kathryn**:  [04:34] The Text Encoding Initiative started out as a
way to think about how to turn humanities' materials into data that
computers could analyze. This was before there was good OCR and even
people who might think that OCR is the way to go for turning text into
something that's machine readable.

[05:12] For scholars in the humanities, particularly people coming
from literary studies, where there was a strong tradition of scholarly
editing, OCR's didn't seem like it was ever going to be the thing, the
right way to go. These folks developed a method...This was before HTML,
can that possibly be the case?

**Cliff**:  [05:42] That rings a bell for me. We'll have to check on
this, but I believe SGML was what they were using at first, right?

**Kathryn**:  [05:52] That's exactly right. Standard General Markup
Language. What these folks found was that SGML was not adequate for
expressing the kinds of characteristics that they wanted to express
about texts.

[06:11] In fact, one of the people who was, at the time, a young
person in the lead group of the TEI and who is now an elder statesman,
Michael Sperberg‑McQueen, was one of the people who was part of the
group that developed XML, which is Extensible Markup Language. That's a
vocabulary for data that's behind almost every application that ordinary
people use in our daily lives, things like Excel and Word.

**Cliff**:  [06:50] It brings to the point that these are technologies
that are ubiquitous, but we don't necessarily see them. Part of the
challenge is bringing them to the form and using them in a critical way
and a conscious way, right?

**Kathryn**:  [07:05] Yes.

**Cliff**:  [07:05] They structure the data in a way that isn't
dictated by a tool, but is actually dictated by intellectual standards.

**Kathryn**:  [07:13] Exactly, and it's not so much about the
marketplace but about, as you say, intellectual standards.

[07:20] One of the things that I like about teaching students the TEI
is that they get to see not just sort of all the things we can consume
on the web, but they get to see a little bit of what's under the hood.
That was more true before Steve Jobs and our friends at Apple came up
with the iPad and we went into the world of apps.

[07:53] It's still really important because there is code underneath
all of that stuff. The more that ordinary non‑engineer folks can
understand that stuff or at least have a little bit of a notion of what
code looks likes and how people and machines talk to each other, the
better I think that is for what we call the Digital Age.

**Cliff**:  [08:25] We've met previously, but we met in Krakow for the
Digital Humanities 2016 Conference and you had brought some students
with you and you held a seminar in advance for the conference.

[08:45] One of the things that I thought was fascinating in the way
that you led that seminar was to walk through a sample TEI document and
then just have the students say, "How would we mark this up?" and just
iteratively add markup to it as students came up with the ideas.

[09:02] I have to say, as I've told you before, just so incredibly
impressed by the students' ability to think about the multiple ways in
you might enrich a text. So obviously, you've been teaching them a lot.
It was a great display of their knowledge.

**Kathryn**:  [09:18] Thanks. They're brilliant students. There were
four of them and they were the students who worked with me on a summer
research project for six weeks before we went to Krakow.

[09:31] It was a really great culmination of their summer research to
have an opportunity to attend a workshop that was led my colleague,
Georg Vogeler, and then also to attend sessions of DH, so that they
could get a sense of where some of what they were learning fit into a
larger, international, scholarly universe.

**Cliff**:  [09:58] One of the things about digital humanities, and I
know that there have been a lot of efforts to make this less true and
I'm sure it is less true than it used to be, but in the beginning, I
think a lot of digital humanities research was clustered around large
research universities, and mainly focused on graduate students.

[10:24] You're working at a liberal arts college and you're working
with undergraduates. How have you been able to adapt these trends in DH
for undergraduate teaching?

**Kathryn**:  [10:36] First, I have to really credit Julia Flanders
and the Women Writers Project, which is now at Northeastern University,
because Julia is one of the people who, with her colleague, Syd Bauman
who's a Senior Programmer at the WWP. One of the main jobs that Julia
has taken on, and had been working on really powerfully in the first
decade of this century, has been just teaching people the TEI.

[11:17] The workshops that I attended were ones that Julia taught and
that were focused particularly on how we might use the TEI for teaching
undergraduates. I never would've done any of this if, on the one hand,
there hadn't been funding and on the other hand, Julia hadn't been there
to do this teaching.

[11:46] Truthfully, Cliff, I jumped in because someone in our academic
computing area said, "Oh, this would be kind of keen. Let's do this." I
wasn't really someone who had done digital humanities before or any of
those kinds of things, but what I discovered, and what was really
appealing to me, was the way that asking students to do transcription
and markup could teach something that's really a challenge to teach as
an undergraduate instructor of history.

[12:29] That is how important it is to spend time with your sources.
We teach students in the history department, or in the history major, we
try to bring them along to a place where by their senior year, at some
point, they can do original research and come up with a product which
we've traditionally thought of as a research paper that is genuine
history. That fits into the discipline.

[13:10] One of the things that I think is always challenging to help
students understand is that necessity of spending time with your sources
and becoming immersed in them. One of the things that transcription and
markup, I hesitate to use this word, but forces, is that close reading
that's really necessary in order to be able to write a historical
narrative.

**Cliff**:  [13:48] I really appreciate that, especially as a former
special collections librarian. That is a more difficult skill to teach
than it seems. It's just because we are so used, in other contexts, to
reading quickly and trying to skim through as much as we can, as quickly
as we can, that to really slow down and to read carefully, it's a hard
challenge for people.

[14:16] It's a hard challenge sometimes because of the digital
technologies that we use. I don't think our ability to concentrate is
necessarily being improved by a lot of the technologies. I've learned
this, and we should also mention, that you've been leading a research
project in the last couple of years called MEDEA. Remind me what MEDEA
stands for? I always stumble a little on this.

**Kathryn**:  [14:44] It stands for Modeling semantically Enhanced
Digital Edition of Accounts. The idea is that there are an embarrassing
number of account books lying around in archives that we haven't done a
lot with. If I say it that way, then I run into the danger that social
and economic historians will jump up and down and say, "But we've been
sampling that stuff for a long time."

[15:17] That's true, but, for instance, documentary projects like the
papers of people like Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and John
Adams, have avoided work with the account books. Documentary projects
are about transcription of the vast papers of people like the Founding
Fathers.

[15:49] They've avoided them because they seem too complex. Partly
because there's a lot of formatting that goes into a ledger, for
example. It's actually very challenging both in print and digitally to
represent the table format.

[16:11] I don't know if you've ever tried to make a website that had a
table on it. It's not an easy thing. I was going to say it used to not
be, but I don't want to sound like the old lady in the room. They seem
too complex to represent fully, like in a full transcription.

[16:39] The fact is that they're incredibly rich. There is all kinds
of information in account books. Not just about money and prices which
has been the focus of economic historians, but about people and how they
interact, and their daily lives.

[16:59] Some colleagues and I are interested in coming up with some
best practices for transcription and markup of account books so that it
would be possible to do some comparisons across time and space. That's
really what MEDEA is about.

**Cliff**:  [17:18] Having participated in that project myself, and
coming to terms with the diversity of ways in which this financial
information was recorded, the real challenge is when you're crossing
such large historical periods and geographic locations, what you realize
is that there isn't going to be a single standard. There may be multiple
overlapping standards for different purposes.

[17:50] Again, it's kind of what you want to achieve and what you want
to get out of working through these sources. Although, I think at least
one of the takeaways I took from this is that establishing a good base
edition with something like the TEI gives you the flexibility then to
extract data from that in different formats. The TEI works really well
in that context as a sort of, would you say, diplomatic transcription, a
way to do diplomatic transcription of these sources?

**Kathryn**:  [18:27] Yeah, the diplomatic edition is one product that
then if you have a good edition, it's possible to extract different bits
of data based on what your research question is.

[18:45] One of the things that my colleague, Georg Vogeler does at the
digital repository that he hosts at Karl‑Franzens University in Graz
in Austria, in this repository, what they host are editions that have
been made in TEI and then there are various kinds of exports that you
can do. You can export the XML if that's what you want. You can also
export into Excel if what you want is the numerical data.

[19:27] That's actually a very important innovation that comes with
thinking about account books from the transcription perspective, the
perspective of producing an edition as opposed to the sampling
perspective that is the focus of social science history.

[19:52] With the edition, you present the entire account and then
allow folks who come after you to make the decision about what to select
out of the account as opposed to making the selections for your series
‑‑ for instance, a price series or something like that ‑‑ and then
leaving behind data that has already been affected by the choices of a
particular set of research questions.

**Cliff**:  [20:22] That was actually maybe even a binding for a lot
of the researchers who participated when they were in the room with
researchers who had different interests and said, "Well, why did you
make this decision in advance because this data could have been very
useful to me."

[20:40] It's partly that we all have our disciplinary blinders on and
that means some of the choices we make might not be the right choices
for other people who are doing different types of research.

**Kathryn**:  [20:53] That's one of the really important takeaways
from the folks who use text encoding, is that the goal is to produce an
edition that one can use for one's own research and then leave behind
something that another research can use for their own purposes that you
or I can't even imagine at the moment.

[21:22] There are a lot of people in the TEI who think that's really
the most exciting thing, is that you can make something, make your own
conclusions out of it, make your own arguments, ask your own research
questions, and then leave something that is complete in a certain way
that someone else can come and put together with something that you
would never think of putting it together with and make something new a
long way down the line.

[21:53] That's one of the really exciting things about digital
humanities, I think, is that the possibilities of the reuse of the
information in interesting ways that you would never think of.

**Cliff**:  [22:07] As we wind up our conversation, this is such a
rich, fascinating conversation. I want to bring it back to the students
again and just ask you, maybe, when you're teaching students, where do
they have the hardest time with the TEI? What are the stumbling blocks
that you see?

**Kathryn**:  [22:31] I try really hard to remember that the students
that I teach are not necessarily students who would encounter any kind
of computer code anyplace else, because they might, for instance, have
what's referred to as math anxiety, and I'm not particularly keen about
that, that the notion of something like math anxiety. I don't
necessarily think that's the real thing.

[23:05] I do think that sometimes students are a little put off, a
little scared of the angle brackets just because they look weird,
they're unfamiliar, even though one of the things about the TEI is that
it's meant to be human readable as well as machine readable.

[23:28] There are students who are just the tiniest bit freaked out by
something that doesn't look like words that you see printed on a page or
a screen. One of the cool things, one of the ways to deal with that is
that the editor that we use, which is Oxygen, actually has two modes.
There's one, a mode called author mode and one called editor mode.

[23:55] If students are freaked out by the angle brackets, they can do
the initial transcription in this author mode, which is a cleaner mode
that allows them just to see the letters and numbers on the screen.

[24:15] That's the place where students face the biggest challenge and
where I'm really pleased to say that the tool allows us to deal with the
challenge in a useful way.

**Cliff**:  [24:34] I can also say we've met similar challenges even
working with librarians who are unfamiliar with XML and, with a little
help from CSS and the author mode, you can a long way of easing people
into things. They learn if all they need to go in and make some changes
on the markup, they can switch and they get their toes in the water and
it becomes more of a familiar environment to them.

**Kathryn**:  [25:02] Exactly.

**Cliff**:  [25:06] Again, this has been a really wonderful
conversation. We always end by asking our guest, what is your favorite
analog technology for education technology?

**Kathryn**:  [25:16] Discussion.

[25:16] [laughter]

**Kathryn**:  [25:25] Am I allowed to just use one word?

**Cliff**:  [25:28] That's a great word. Are you thinking a seminar
style conversing?

**Kathryn**:  [25:31] Yeah, I've never been a person who was
particularly comfortable with lecture. I've always felt like the
classroom works best when it's interactive. Surely you know this, Cliff,
you have to have a plan for what's going to come out in a class meeting,
no matter what. You can achieve that by lecturing for exactly 80 minutes
and feeling really great when you finish whatever it is that you were
going to say at exactly the 80‑minute mark. That's one option.

[26:20] I really believe in active learning and I really think that
students learn the most when they are actively engaged in thinking
things through. I really like even when it may look like I'm lecturing,
I really like bringing the students in and using discussion.

[26:48] I don't just mean the Socratic Method, because I hate the
"What is teacher thinking" game. Getting the students talking and giving
them an opportunity to come up with ideas on their own is my favorite
thing to do.

[27:07] The fact is that transcription and markup, and all these other
things that I do are just a different way to do that.

**Cliff**:  [27:15] That's a perfect place to end this conversation.
Thank you again. This has been so lovely to talk with you. I've learned
a lot. There will be show notes about many things that we talked about,
too.

[27:29] Thanks again, Kathryn, really appreciate it.
