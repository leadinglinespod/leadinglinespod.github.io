## Episode 12: Cassandra Horii

[00:00] [music]

**Derek Bruff**: [00:00] Welcome to "Leading Lines", a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, Director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching. In this podcast, we explore creative,
intentional, and effective uses of technology to enhance student
learning, uses that point the way to the future of educational
technology in college and university settings.

[00:22] In this episode, we feature an interview with Cassandra Horii,
Director of the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach, at the
California Institute for Technology.

[00:28] Cassandra has been a friend and colleague of mine for years,
and I was excited to talk with her about a couple of the ed‑tech
projects her center is supporting at Caltech. Both projects involve
making student learning visible in interesting ways.

[00:40] We spoke at the annual conference of the Pod Network, a
professional organization for people who work at teaching centers, like
Cassandra and me.

[00:47] [music]

**Derek**: [00:50] Cassandra, it's nice to be with you here at the
Pod Conference in Louisville.

**Cassandra Horii**: [00:55] You too, Derek. It's great to see you.

**Derek**: [00:59] We're here with a bunch of teaching center folks,
and folks who do educational development of all kinds. It's been a
really great conference. I've enjoyed it. I hope you have too.

**Cassandra**: [01:07] I have. We're over 900 strong. It's great to
see this community grow.

**Derek**: [01:11] Absolutely. You had a little bit of professional
news, I think, two nights ago in relation to POD. What is your new
title?

**Cassandra**: [01:18] I did. I am the president‑elect elect, which
means I will be president‑elect in about March of 2017.

**Derek**: [01:26] Congratulations.

**Cassandra**: [01:27] Thank you.

**Derek**: [01:27] I was very excited to hear that news. [laughs]

**Cassandra**: [01:30] I am so excited. I think this is going to be,
perhaps, a much better three years for POD than four years for the
nation, but we shall see. In any case, we've got some really wonderful
new directions to pursue.

**Derek**: [01:44] Tell me a little bit about your professional
background and how you got to the position that you're in now at
Caltech.

**Cassandra**: [01:50] I am a scientist by training. My undergraduate
background is in physics and my graduate work is in environmental
science. I did spectroscopic measurements of atmospheric trace gasses.
I, along that academic route, had a strong interest in how the learning
process was unfolding in the classes I was taking as an undergraduate
and eventually teaching as a graduate student.

[02:13] Eventually, those questions about how we do higher education,
the processes underlying learning, and ultimately the processes that
shape how our organizations function to support learning and how we
think about teaching became very, very compelling to me. I decided to
pursue that direction along the way.

[02:32] I taught expository writing, first‑year writing, for several
years full‑time to be able to learn more about other kinds of teaching
domains and methods that we don't use so much in the sciences. Then have
worked in several administrative capacities, meeting and contributing to
educational development efforts on different campuses.

**Derek**: [02:53] Then, a couple of years ago you got to go to
Caltech.

**Cassandra**: [02:55] Yes. At Caltech, about four years ago now, we
started a new center, the Center for Teaching, Learning, and Outreach.
We worked pretty broadly. We worked with the faculty. We're working on
educational innovation. We're redesigning courses and working with the
institution on the curriculum.

[03:14] We're training the future faculty who are coming out of our
institution, who are also, often, our current teaching assistants. We do
a lot with educational technology. We're a primary office supporting
online courses and massive open online courses, and really helping the
institution use educational technology well and think about its use and
application.

[03:40] We partner a great deal with our IT‑type Department and do
that work hand‑in‑hand. Often, we're at the table, IT is at the table,
instructors are at the table to design an approach from the ground up
that is clear about learning objectives and big picture goals and
integrates across the media, technology, and instructional approaches.

**Derek**: [04:06] That sounds very exciting.

**Cassandra**: [04:07] Well, that's the ideal. We try for it.

**Derek**: [04:10] Can you tell us about a few projects that you've
been involved with in the tech realm?

**Cassandra**: [04:15] Sure. When you asked me this question of
projects that we might want to talk about, I thought of a couple. Then,
I was thinking about what unified the theme that made those the exciting
ones to talk about for me.

[04:30] I think that underlying theme is really those places that we
have used technology to make thinking visible in a different way,
whether it's in the classroom frequently or in collaborative technology
enabled‑types of space. No matter whether while we're in person, or
asynchronously, or at distance.

[04:53] A couple of those, in particular, I'll start with a really
concrete one, which is a problem that, maybe, some other campuses face.
We have some classrooms that are not as conducive to collaborative or
active learning as we would like them to be and increasingly, as our
faculty or instructors would like them to be.

[05:13] Yet, we can't magically wave a wand and make those changes. In
some cases, we've been able to pack those spaces, using cheap, not super
high tech, but a combination of technology to transform what happens
even despite the barriers that we have.

[05:33] In particular, a recent example is a class that was about
numerical methods in chemical engineering of all things. The frustration
that the instructor came with was about how to bring the complexity of
the coding that needed to happen into this classroom which was
frustratingly fixed seats, and ultimately...

**Derek**: [06:00] Should I imagine that traditional college lecture
hall here?

**Cassandra**: [06:02] Please do imagine a traditional college
lecture hall, and like many others on our campus, plenty of blackboard
space. We've got nine sliding chalkboards across...

**Derek**: [06:13] Actual chalkboards?

**Cassandra**: [06:13] the fronts of the room. Yes.

**Derek**: [06:15] Not whiteboard, chalkboard?

**Cassandra**: [06:16] In this case, yes. Chalkboards which are our
favorite still on our campus and have their own wonderful affordances
and I actually wouldn't want to get rid of them...

**Derek**: [06:23] [laughs]

**Cassandra**: [06:24] even if we took out all the fixed seats. It's
the fixed seating that was making it really for students to work
together.

[06:31] As we talked with the professor, the real challenge was that
the instructor couldn't access how students were thinking, what they
were doing. He just couldn't see their computer screens.

[06:43] He had tried having them bring their laptops into class,
having some group problem solving, and it always devolved into each
student alone on their laptop or a lecture. He was really having trouble
finding this middle ground.

[07:01] We talked about it and defined that problem along with the
learning objectives, which had to do with this nimble thinking that was
able to transition between the chemical engineering, and the coding, and
the numerical methods, and the techniques, but be able to bounce back
and forth and talk about those together.

[07:25] We came up with the solution. We were able to get a hold of a
small set of very small micro projectors. You plug it to your VGA outlet
or to your dongle if you're on a Mac. They're very small handheld. It's
about the size of what? A walkman if you're from the '90s.

[07:54] [laughter]

**Derek**: [07:54] I get the reference, yeah. A small paperback book.

**Cassandra**: [08:00] Thank you. That's a better reference, a small
paperback book. They can clip onto the back of one of our beautiful
fixed seats. In this space, we happen to have wall space that could be
projected onto.

[08:15] We were able to cluster students around a wall with a mini
projector. Assign roles to the group work around problems so you have
the one student with the computer that was the projector. We also used
cling sheets that through static just stick to the wall and create a
whiteboard surface in multiple spots around the room.

[08:37] We had then the student who was the whiteboard marker person
who was charting the big ideas, the chemical engineering ideas
underlying the coding exercise, so that those were displayed alongside
the actual code and the results of running the code, and then the
students who were contributing to that conversation and helping with the
problem solving.

[08:58] Now we have teams, we have roles, and we've made the thinking
visible. What the professor ended up saying about this experience, and
did a brave thing to change course halfway through the class having
tried a few things ‑‑ that's hard to do, but was just in super
enthusiastic and amazed that it was being able to see and intervene in
those dual thought processes in real time.

[09:30] That was the really exciting change that happened. To be able
to see maybe an error or misconception in the chemistry or in the
engineering concepts, maybe an error or a misconception in the coding.

[09:45] Or a misunderstanding of how a package routine, or some plugin
that they were using was running which was leading to a magnification of
error or something like that, and being able to stop and compare those
ideas right in real time.

**Derek**: [10:02] Wow. I love that. [laughs]

**Cassandra**: [10:04] We loved it too.

**Derek**: [10:05] Part of it is that on my campus, we have a lot of
these large, traditional lecture rooms. I'm always trying to think
creatively about how to make them more active learning spaces. I like
the technology choice there.

[10:18] Some high‑tech, some low‑tech, but also the process change in
the classroom. The group roles, the ability for the instructor to
circulate and interact and see the student learning. That's really
powerful.

**Cassandra**: [10:31] It was also fun to see what students did with
this space. We had some ideas about where they would put these visible
learning, low‑tech, high‑tech kits around the room.

[10:44] Some of them threw that out the window and ended up clustered
on the floor, around a different spot in the room, using multiple cling
whiteboard sheets, overlaying the whiteboard sheet with the projection
so that they could annotate the projection or the code in a different
way in real time.

**Derek**: [11:05] That's great.

**Cassandra**: [11:06] It gave the students some agency to be able to
use the tools in different ways as well. Going forward, that's in place
and we've now packaged this active learning, visible‑thinking kit into
something that instructors, during other terms, can use or might choose
to adopt in different ways.

**Derek**: [11:28] Other projects? You said there were several.

**Cassandra**: [11:30] That was one example. The other that we've
done a little bit more rigorous assessment and study of is an online
platform that was developed at Caltech. It's called SKIES. It stands for
Su‑Kam Intelligent Educational System. I might have to go back and look
up what that means. We might have to edit that out.

**Derek**: [11:52] [laughs] SKIES?

**Cassandra**: [11:52] SKIES, so skieslearn if you're looking for
where that sits online. The platform is one thing, but what it does is
put a course or a session or a little part of a lesson into a knowledge
tree format, and one that is accessible to all students at the same
time, with real‑time updates.

[12:19] We've taken the thinking, which might be otherwise a linear
set of slides or something like that, if someone's using technology to
do presentation. Of course, there are lots of ways to make that
non‑linear and lay it out in different ways. There's Prezi, there's
other methods like that.

[12:35] This one, though, because it has that real‑time update and
lets an entire class of students be either adding to the tree or
responding to places in the knowledge tree.

**Derek**: [12:45] I'm imagining a family tree, where you have
branches coming out?

**Cassandra**: [12:49] Yes, imagine a family tree. A little bit
different than a family tree, you might imagine one primary spine of
knowledge that threads through that helps the instructor be able to lend
a structure and an outline, a scaffold, to what might happen in the
class or to a sequence of learning that's intended for the students.

[13:12] Off of that, yes, imagine that family tree structure. At
different places from that spine, you'll see one branch, maybe a
question that a student asks, maybe a question the instructor poses,
that can then have multiple responses. Clicker‑type questions can be
embedded there.

**Derek**: [13:30] So, not just content or visuals or slides, but
questions, interactions, and discussions?

**Cassandra**: [13:35] Absolutely. What the platform does is pretty
flexible. Like any technology, you've got to use it intentionally, but
some of the places where we've seen that really help are where the
class, in a way, uses this knowledge tree as a Wiki.

[13:52] At different points during an in‑class session, the instructor
might pause and ask a question and get students to...they might actually
sketch something in their notebook in response, take a photo and post
it.

**Derek**: [14:06] And put that in the knowledge tree.

**Cassandra**: [14:08] Put that in the knowledge tree for everyone to
be able to see. We've had instances where it's being used in a lab or a
demo‑type environment and students can do a brief little experiment,
desktop‑type experiment, record the results, and post that for everyone
to see.

[14:26] They might have different cases that they're applying,
different test conditions, and be able to pool that back knowledge
together, or just a conceptual question that goes in. Again, it's with
the instructor's scaffolding, being able to see multiple students think,
ask, answer, and contribute to that.

[14:48] There's a motivation that we see in being able to contribute
back to the class environment in real‑time as well as just access to
different points of view, and a peer teaching that can happen in
answering other students' questions as well.

**Derek**: [15:07] It sounds also, this piece where whatever you're
talking about now is connected to everything else. You can situate this
topic or this question in the bigger picture of the course.

**Cassandra**: [15:20] Yes, and being able to actually see how that
fits together is, we seem to find, a pretty helpful thing.

**Derek**: [15:29] Let me ask an educational development question.
For something like SKIES, that sounds like, if I were to use that well
as an instructor, I might have to make some big changes to my course.
Have you found that to be the case and, if so, how do you help faculty
navigate how they change their own teaching when they start to use
technologies in intentional ways?

**Cassandra**: [15:57] Absolutely. Probably like many other
educational developers, we always want to be driven by a pretty clear
learning goal. In reality, that's not always where people start.
Sometimes people do start with, "Hey, there's this cool new thing. I
think it might be useful. I want to try it out."

[16:17] Honestly, I think that's an authentic place to begin and we
don't close the door on that beginning point, but I think we want to
back up a step and try to clarify, "Why this? What attracted you about
this widget piece of technology approach?" Offer some parallel,
potential solutions.

[16:39] Where we might have another tool with some similar
functionality but that might better meet the need, we'll put that in the
mix as well and try to do some applicability testing. This is a little
bit of maybe my personal manifesto about educational technology.

**Derek**: [16:58] I would love to hear your personal manifesto.

**Cassandra**: [17:01] I call it that in the graduate class that I
teach about Pedagogy, about teaching and learning and higher education
and particular in STEM fields. First, there's the goal, the learning
goal. Maybe it doesn't come first but eventually, we want to be clear
about that.

[17:16] There is matching the technology to the goal and that can mean
nine chalkboards. There's a clear, sometimes, need we find especially in
derivation‑type problems, in very logical things like mathematical
proofs.

[17:35] Where there's a thread of thinking that ‑‑ I'm going to say it
again ‑‑ we need to have to be visible all at once to students that we
can lose when we don't have the ability to spread that out over time and
physically, in the room, over multiple chalkboards. [laughs] There's a
use for that. Does the technology match the goals?

[17:59] These other pieces, I think, sometimes get lost, which is why
it's part of my manifesto, but one is how are you going to integrate it?
Once you've chosen a piece of technology, can you clearly explain why
you're using it to students? Make time for that explanation to happen in
the class, and build it in, weave it in to the thread of everything that
happens in the course.

[18:23] Where does it show up in assignments? Where does it show up in
credit or in assessment, whether or not that's just assessment for
feedback ‑‑ an informative kind of assessment ‑‑ or whether it's into
the grade for the class? Sometimes, that's at a very low level if it's
low stakes, and it doesn't matter exactly what students say or how they
answer but that they're engaged.

[18:46] That piece is key, and often gets skipped. We try to dwell on
that piece as much as possible and provide people with some tools for
integration. If I go back to our hacking of a classroom example, one of
the tools for integration that we helped with was a little laminated
guide to group work that goes with every little projector.

[19:09] It's a half sheet. It's on bright‑colored paper, but when the
student team gets that mini projector, they also get group or team
roles, on a piece of paper. On the other side is some tech support
points for how to turn the projector on.

[19:23] The group work guide goes with the projector for them to look
at. That's something the instructor said, "I would never have thought of
that. It's really great that it's here." So, integration.

[19:37] There's a fourth point to my manifesto. I know we're only
supposed to have three in anything, but I have four.

**Derek**: [19:43] [laughs]

**Cassandra**: [19:43] The fourth is that I strongly believe that
teaching is a deeply personal act. It has to do with the self of the
instructor, with being comfortable and confident. There's a
communication approach that has to do with it.

[20:01] I think if you or your listeners think back to any memorable
instructor that they had, that person's authentic self is a part of the
picture, most likely, and a part of what makes them a memorable, human
figure that stands out.

[20:20] We try to make this explicit with the folks that we're working
with, that we're consulting with. If they have chosen a technology and
have a goal and even have thought about integration, but the thing
itself feels uncomfortable or just doesn't work for them or it takes one
too many steps or they have to type in a way in front of students that
they mess up and feel bad about, that's not going to be sustainable.

[20:48] We want to do some actual human testing in terms of usability
and personal fit for any application of technology because when it just
doesn't fit, it goes by the wayside almost immediately. Any kind of
misfit gets amplified when we're in a classroom full of students or in
front of people.

[21:16] Likewise, I think if it's a good fit, that good fit can get
amplified because there's a comfort there and a confidence that students
will feel, sense, and pick up on and will be more open to adopting that
as their own tool that they are feeling comfortable using it as well.

**Derek**: [21:32] One follow‑up question. I do wonder, you've been
at a few different types of institutions over time. Is there anything
about the research university context that shapes how you work with
faculty or how you think about technology?

**Cassandra**: [21:47] Well, the research university environment, the
environments that I've been in are strongly characterized by an
independence and an individuality among, let's call them principle
investigators.

[22:02] I think that is the ethos that drives research forward is that
individual, or it's a group effort. It's a collective effort. It's also
not an entire school or department effort. It's got a local environment
to it. That really drives a lot.

[22:24] Perhaps, a little bit unlike some other environments where
there can be a one‑size, we're all going to use X. We have the one
adopted technology for whatever the purpose is, and that's really
institutionalized. At least, in the environments I've been in that are
characterized as high research, that just hasn't worked.

[22:45] As new solutions bubble up, people want to be able to have the
freedom to try new things out. It means for educational development, I
think, at tech support we have to stay nimble. We have to be willing to
switch things around and try things out, be willing to up our expert
game on any new things that are coming out pretty quickly, figure out
their functionality.

[23:12] Test them out, see if we can break them from a learning
perspective, and anticipate what some of the problems will be.

[23:21] It also means that we have to be pretty modular because
there's not going to be one, central place that for every class,
students will go to find the technology that they'll use. Sometimes, our
campus systems can't keep up with that. Not all of them might be
integrated to the single sign‑in system.

[23:40] There might be some actual security concerns that arise from
that. We'll have to have those conversations about what to inform
students if we're going to use a third‑party platform about their
passwords and their user names. Making sure those are different from
their university accounts.

[23:56] Thinking about what information they want to put there. Having
instructors think about what information they need to be careful about
putting on those outside platforms, but we don't want to stop them from
using them or trying them out.

**Derek**: [24:09] There's a lot of creativity and an entrepreneurial
spirit that comes there, right?

**Cassandra**: [24:13] Yes.

**Derek**: [24:14] You want to foster that, while also, providing the
support and the need.

**Cassandra**: [24:18] Absolutely. It means it's pretty
time‑intensive to be driven by that individualistic entrepreneurial
spirit and be able to keep up with it. We don't even try to pretend to
get ahead of it. I thought about this early in our center's development.
Were we going to have some dedicated time to scanning the environment
and seeing what's out there, what's next?

[24:46] It's turned out that that's not something we can do in a
comprehensive way. We don't set aside time in our calendars to scan the
environment and test new pieces because they'll come to us when it's of
interest. We're going to hear about it, and that's when we kick into
high gear and figure out what it's all about ‑‑ how to use it and how to
support it.

**Derek**: [25:06] The name of our podcast is "Leading Lines," and we
try to not predict the future of educational technology but, maybe,
shape it a little or, at least, talk about what we'd like to see there.
What are some things you'd like to see happening over the next two,
three, four years in education technology?

**Cassandra**: [25:22] Well, that's exciting to try to get to shape
this. Let's see if it works. We can get back together in three, four
years and check it out. I think you'll have a blog post about that, I'm
sure, at some point.

[25:35] [laughter]

**Derek**: [25:35] I might.

**Cassandra**: [25:37] We were just talking about that sense of being
nimble and entrepreneurial, and being able to follow the nose of
something interesting, follow the scent of a new possibility for
learning.

[25:50] From an instructor side, and an instructor‑focused support
side, we can figure out how to do that. I think that still poses some
real challenges for the student experience side. We're a small enough
institution that people can figure out who to ask and talk to their
housemates or their roommates and try to figure it out.

[26:18] In other environments, that might be more difficult for
students who are less familiar with how the institutional and tech
infrastructure works for some of the purposes. There will always be
cases where there's a rogue implementation of a technology that we
haven't touched and doesn't have the integration and the personal factor
and the goals haven't been totally clarified.

[26:44] It would be a dream for me. I know for colleagues on my campus
to keep that nimble ability to respond and try new things, but plug it
in in a modular way to a more unified experience for students.

[27:03] Honestly, I don't know how that could be accomplished, but if
our, for example, learning management systems themselves could be more
nimble to be able to modularly plug things in.

[27:16] I think, in some sense, they're headed in that direction, but
to make that a little easier from the instructor side, to plug it in and
have it be more seamless for students. That goes both ways, for the
student to access where they need to go to do their learning but
immediately be able to see the tools that are at play in a particular
learning environment.

[27:38] It also goes the other way, to be able to have the student
learning data come back into the central place or dashboard or system,
that instructors can access and hold it all together. That's my dream.

**Derek**: [27:53] It's getting better, right?

**Cassandra**: [27:54] Yeah.

**Derek**: [27:54] There is the initial like, "Hey" that single sign
on kind of thing. You can pass around dedication, but we're getting
better tools for bringing the data back. I think what's a little bit
challenging...in that respect I think some course management systems are
starting to change in that they are becoming this connective tissue
around other tools.

[28:15] We are heading in that direction. I do wonder about the
student's experience about that though because they're still...Yes, I
sign in here, and now I have, for this course, these are the tools that
are being used. For this course, those are the tools.

[28:29] There's an organizational piece that's very helpful for
students, but there's still, for every course I've got, different things
that I'm trying to figure out and use and learn, right?

**Cassandra**: [28:40] Yes.

**Derek**: [28:41] I don't know if there's a technology solution to
that, but I think of these students who come to college...I'll have my
students blog. Usually, 1 out of 15 will have any actual blogging
experience. Or I might have to use Twitter. I actually haven't done that
yet, but I could have them use Twitter. Maybe, a lot of them have
Twitter experience but it's not in any academic sense.

[29:05] I want them to do these very specific academic things with the
platform, and they're used to using it for pure social and entertainment
purposes. In either case, whether they've never used it or they've used
it in completely different ways, they've got to figure out cognitively,
what are the moves we're making with this tool in this course?

[29:23] That's a little bit challenged. I don't know how to address
that, but I think there's a learned piece, learning how to learn with
technology that, maybe, we haven't paid enough attention to.

**Cassandra**: [29:35] I think that comes back to the integration
piece. Perhaps, a more controversial idea is whether those ‑‑ and I
loved that you called it connective tissue, if LMSU is the connective
tissue among these tools ‑‑ if that connective tissue might have the
intelligence to help the faculty member build the scaffold.

[29:55] If that connective tissue is set up to really not just plug in
the technology, but articulate the purpose of it. There still has to be
a human articulating that purpose, but we can certainly structure the
instructor experience potentially to prompt for that, to make it a clear
part of the process.

[30:18] I say controversial because I think some of the MOOC platforms
have moved in this direction from the course builder side. There are now
more evident checkpoints for incorporating learning goals and outcomes
and having a course structure that clarifies what the objectives are and
how the pieces fit together.

[30:39] They're working with a limited set of tools. t times, at least
on our campus, that has felt a little bit heavy‑handed as well. It has
its own marketing purpose to it. It also has...

[30:51] [crosstalk]

**Derek**: [30:51] Here, you can teach a course on a platform, but it
has to look this," right?.

**Cassandra**: [30:54] Yes, it also has that a little bit of a cookie
cutter feel to it. It also has a different motive, potentially, than
just teaching the students who are in the room. It has a marketing
reach.

[31:11] There's nothing wrong with that, but it raises these questions
about motives and conformity, and freedom to do things differently.
There's a fine line, I think, between intelligent scaffolding and
heavy‑handedness that has to be navigated.

**Derek**: [31:27] It also occurs to me that this idea that we can
make the student experience a little more seamless, a little more
coherent, a little more...I don't know that they'll get that when they
leave us.

**Cassandra**: [31:39] Yeah, that's absolutely true.

**Derek**: [31:40] The ability to be in this new professional
environment, and pick up a tool that folks are already using, and figure
out how it's been used and how I can use it effectively. That's may be a
transferable set of skills that we could help our students develop.

[31:55] I'm torn between, again, standardizing and making things
routine, because that makes somethings a lot easier, but it also may
inhibit a certain skill development, whether we're talking about the
students or the teachers.

**Cassandra**: [32:10] Absolutely. We think along a continuum of
expertise. In an educational setting, we want to build a scaffold that's
a little taller and sturdier for earlier experiences, and slowly
dismantle that scaffolds so that less and less of it is needed over
time. I don't think a technology can necessarily do that for us. We
still need humans.

**Derek**: [32:34] I'm going end with the question we asked all of
our guests. We spend a lot of time talking about digital educational
technologies on this podcast. What's one of your favorite analog
educational technologies? You've mentioned a couple already.

**Cassandra**: [32:48] I have. I do happen to really like
chalkboards, a lot. I like whiteboards too. I think there is something
about the largeness of a surface that lets us play in a different way,
that lets us lay things out flexibly.

[33:07] The ability to erase, and reshape, and reform, and use color,
and to move through the space while we're thinking about our ideas. I
think those are all powerful pieces of non‑digital technology. That
said, we also have had fun with those cling sheets that stick to the
wall and make it writable anywhere, and temporarily.

**Derek**: [33:29] In what I'm hearing though, in both of those
examples, is when we think of chalkboards, we tend to think of the
instructor using it, but there's no rule that says that has to be.

**Cassandra**: [33:39] Absolutely. Some of our most favored, flexible
teaching spaces are ones with floor to ceiling chalkboards and couches.
There are places where groups of students are doing active problem
solving with facilitated help of teaching assistants or learning
assistants. Those are just beloved.

**Derek**: [34:03] Thank you very much for talking with me today. I
really enjoyed it.

[34:06] [background music]

**Cassandra**: [34:06] Thank you, Derek. I've enjoyed it too.

**Derek**: [34:08] That was Cassandra Horii, director of the Center
