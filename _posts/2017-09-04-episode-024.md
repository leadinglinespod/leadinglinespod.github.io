In this episode, we continue exploring one of the themes of this season of Leading Lines: non-traditional assignments. We talk with Haerin (Helen) Shin, assistant professor of English at Vanderbilt University, who gives her students a choice for final projects: a traditional research paper or a creative, usually digital, project. Helen describes a few examples of digital projects, talks about how she structures and scaffolds these assignments, and explains why these nontraditional assignments help her students achieve her learning objectives.
