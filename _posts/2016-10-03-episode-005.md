In this episode, we feature an interview with Lee Forester, Professor of German at Hope College, and Bill VanPatten, Professor of Spanish and Second Language Studies at Michigan State University. Stacey M. Johnson, Assistant Director for Educational Technology at the Vanderbilt University Center for Teaching, sat down with Forester and VanPatten at a language teaching conference last summer.  Both faculty members have developed online learning materials, including textbooks, for language instruction, and Stacey’s conversation with the two professors explored ways that instructors use digital textbooks and publisher-provided learning platforms.

As a companion to this podcast episode, Stacey Johnson has created a new teaching guide on working with publisher-provided online platforms, shared as part of the Vanderbilt Center for Teaching’s collection of more than 70 teaching guides on various topics.  The new guide features more audio from Lee Forester and Bill VanPatten, as well as other language instructors Stacey interviewed recently.

More on this episode’s guests:

Lee Forester is Professor of German at Hope College, where he teaches all levels of German.  He is the co-founder of a small textbook publishing company called Evia Learning, and co-author of three language textbooks: Auf geht's! (beginning German), Weiter geht's! (intermediate German) and Ritmos (beginning Spanish). His research and curricular work focus on effective use of technology, intercultural learning and creating language materials that  promote personal transformation for students.

Bill VanPatten is Professor of Spanish and Second Language Studies at the Michigan State University.  He has published seven books, seven edited volumes, six language textbooks (including the movies Sol y viento, Liaisons, and the tele series Destinos), and 120 articles and book chapters. Two of his articles are listed in the top ten citations for articles in Studies in Second Language Acquisition and he has received local and national awards for his research, teaching, leadership, and mentoring.  He is a frequently invited speaker within the United States and abroad. He is also the host of a popular podcast on Second Language Acquisition called Tea with BVP.

Episode 5: Lee Forester and Bill VanPatten

[00:00] [background music]

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:07] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast, from
Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derrick Bruff, Director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching. In this podcast we explore creative,
intentional, and effective uses of technology to enhance student
learning, uses that point the way to the future of educational
technology in college and university settings.

[00:24] As I mentioned before, we have a team here at Vanderbilt
conducting the interviews we're sharing on the podcast. Each of us
approaches the general topic of educational technology from our unique
perspective, which allows us to explore many aspects of EdTech, here on
the podcast. Joining me today is one member of that team, Stacey
Johnson.

[00:41] She's the assistant director for educational technology, at
the Vanderbilt Center for Teaching ‑‑ one of my colleagues here at the
CFT. Stacey conducted the interview we're sharing in this episode.
Stacey, would you set the interview up for us?

**Stacey Johnson**:  [00:53] Sure, Derek. I wanted to learn more about
how faculty use digital textbooks, specifically the online learning
platform provided by many textbook publishers.

[01:04] I invited two of my favorite colleagues, both materials
developers and faculty members, to sit down for a chat with me, at a
language teaching conference this past summer.

[01:13] Lee Forester is Professor of German at Hope College, cofounder
of a small textbook publishing company called Evia Learning, and
coauthor of three language textbooks in both German and Spanish. His
work focuses on effective use of technology, intercultural learning and
creating language materials that promote personal transformation for his
students.

[01:34] Bill VanPatten is widely known for his work in second language
acquisition, and as the host of the popular podcast about language
teaching, called "Tea with BVP." He has published six language textbooks
‑‑ all of which, I am excited to tell you, include innovative digital
components, such as telenovelas and full‑length documentary films ‑‑
seven books, seven edited volumes, and 120 articles and book chapters.

[02:04] Because Lee, Bill, and I are all language teachers, we often
talk about language teaching during the interview, and the importance of
communicative language teaching and meaningful interactions.

[02:16] For our listeners that are not language teachers, I want to
tell you that communicative materials require students to go beyond the
memorization of discreet points, like grammar and vocabulary, and
interact in a meaningful way, use the language they're learning. It
moves instruction out of the realm of the theoretical and asks students
to engage in performance‑based activities.

[02:37] As you can probably imagine, it's not easy to find good
digital materials that emphasize communicative tasks, rather than the
memorization of discrete items. In this podcast, Bill and Lee help us
understand why that might be.

[02:52] I started off by asking Lee and Bill how they got started in
publishing online learning materials.

[02:57] [background music]

**Lee Forester**:  [03:00] Many years ago I felt there wasn't very
good use of technology for my immediate need of beginning German
classes. There were these course management systems and other things,
but I didn't think the activities were designed very well.

[03:11] I felt that, in what was before ‑‑ and now we call flipping
the classroom ‑‑ but my feeling was we needed to get more use, and get
more comprehensible input to students outside of the classroom, and not
rely solely on instructors to deliver that in class as I was taught in
the '80s with communicative teaching.

[03:27] I started working on an alternative textbook. About half of
the content would be multimedia. There would be lots of audio, lots of
listening.

**Stacey**:  [03:36] What year was this?

**Lee**:  [03:38] I began working about 2000, a little bit before that
actually. This is what eventually turned into "Auf geht's!" and
[indecipherable] later. Auf geht's! Came out in 2005. Multimedia
based, software based. It wasn't a web based thing at that point.

[03:51] One of the main goals of that was to have students work a lot
more outside of class than they were doing. My experience with standard
textbooks was simply that they didn't do it. If you gave them a reading
pace, they weren't interested in it. They wouldn't do it. You would see
students maybe writing furiously for a couple minutes before class and
that was for their outside engagement.

[04:08] I wanted a platform with a computer that would give them
something that would focus on their short attention spans, would give
them some challenging tasks outside of class that they would actually do
before they came to class, to magnify the amount of time that they spent
on tasks, which is an important part for language learning.

[04:24] That was some of my initial reasons to get involved in trying
to produce language‑learning multimedia. We started in the late '90s and
got a FIPSE grants and did development. FIPSE is the Fund for the
Improvement of Post‑Secondary Education.

[04:36] That was probably right around 2002‑ish, 2001. Then we worked
on it for a number of years, then we released the first version in 2005.
We could not work with a traditional publisher because we didn't want to
give them any control over this, and they wouldn't have funded it
anyway.

[04:52] We wanted to do things like shoot our own photos for a really
large budget. They didn't want to do that. We wanted to have more
control. We decided ‑‑ we being my partner David and Tony and I ‑‑ to
start her own company to do it.

**Bill VanPatten**:  [05:04] I got started in technology in the mid
'90s actually. I was as acting chair at the time in my department. What
happened is the university had just decided that it wanted a
three‑semester requirement across the campus for languages.

[05:19] No matter what discipline you were in, no matter what school,
you had to take minimum of three semesters of a language. Of course we
all know what language is going to get hit the most by that, Spanish,
the potential problem that we would have, anywhere from 50 percent to
100 percent increase in student population.

[05:36] No budget for instructors, and TAs, and so on. This is before
there was anything you could find out there on [indecipherable] , so
we used a local platform that was developed in Urbana, called Mallard,
because ducks have web feet, get web.

**Stacey**:  [05:51] I got you. [laughs]

**Bill**:  [05:52] It's a web‑based platform, and then we created all
the materials ourselves. We launched hybrid flipped classrooms in
Urbana, cut our days down, from four days a week, to two days a week.
When I was hired at Michigan State more recently...I forget what year it
happened before I got there, but they had gone from four days a week, to
three days a week, but kept four hours credit

[06:22] The person in charge of the program didn't really know what to
do with that credit, and was using commercial materials, in a company
that shall not be named, and just making students to stop on language,
because students hated it.

[06:37] When I came in and took over, both Spanish and French, then
dean charged me with "Bring this things in the line here, make this
work." I developed all the online materials myself, along with Lee Anne
Spino, who was my researcher at the time, and Danny Ortega helped, of
course, as our technology person.

[06:57] Then I hired Walter, and Walter came to start helping us this
first year. Then, within two years, we had completely redone the Spanish
program, and then I turned around and did the French program, in the
same way.

[07:10] As I've told some people I worked with in publishing industry,
hybrid language instruction has to be local. If you try to commercialize
it, it's not going to work, because publishes don't know how to make the
right kind of materials, for online environments.

**Stacey**:  [07:25] I agree with that statement...

[07:27] [laughter]

**Stacey**:  [07:27] in full heart, and I think one of the questions
I'm always asking people is "How can we make things that both sell and
work?"

**Bill**:  [07:38] It's all about educating people to be better
consumers. Because what you have is a market‑driven economy in
publishing, and publishers only sell that which buys. You have this
vicious cycle...I published an article about this in 1998, in anyone
wants to read it...

[07:52] [laughter]

**Bill**:  [07:53] about this vicious cycle, where publishers produce
what people want, and people tell publishers what they want, and there
is no way for advances in [indecipherable] too happen, for people like
us, me and Lee, and other people to break in.

[08:08] What we want to do and what we know should happen, in text
books, outside of class, in class, it's not going to make it in most
text books, because the consumer doesn't know what to do with it, and
it's all about white text books aren't communicative even though they
call themselves communicative.

[08:24] What we have to do is educate the consumer, the public, so
they ask for materials that aren't there. That's the only way the
publishers will do it, or you do things like start your own companies.

**Stacey**:  [08:37] One thing I'm interested in, though, you actually
worked within the existing system, you worked with big publishers, and
you still managed to come out with electronic supplements for text books
that are really useful. So...?

**Bill**:  [08:49] Yes and no.

**Stacey**:  [08:50] Yeah. What do you think you've improved?

**Bill**:  [08:53] I have been ‑‑ maybe Le will disagree, I don't know
‑‑ looking at text books the last five years or so, I think text books
have taken a major step backwards. They are less communicative than they
were before, they're less proficiency [indecipherable] they were
before, and the step that's available as homeworking online, is worse
than it was 10 years ago.

[09:13] I don't know what's happened. I don't know, and I'm speaking
for Spanish, a little bit for French, too, because I work in both
languages, I can't speak for German or Russian, and other languages, but
I have my suspicions.

[09:28] Something's happened with this, there's been a regression.
It's a lack of knowledge, it's a lack of the ability of the consumer, to
ask for something different.

[09:39] I kind of think I know what's happened, but I would be
speculating. In my own materials, I can't vouch for certain, because I
don't create all the online stuff, because textbooks are so unwieldy to
do, that's why you have a team of four people doing a textbook.

[09:57] There's so many components, so many things you've got to do,
by the time you get to that online component, you go "God, I've got the
instructors manual. Can we hire someone else to do it?"

[10:06] They take care of it, and next thing you know, it's not what
you really want, but it is too late.

**Lee**:  [10:11] You should almost do it the other way around,
because that's the key component for student's work with outside class,
and instructors we can kind of work with, if we can train our
instructors to teach better in class, or to handle things.

[10:21] I think it's a real shame that what is really the key things
students interact with outside of the classroom gets the worst of the
resources.

**Bill**:  [10:28] I would agree, but that's because publishers are
still operating...this is another thing, we had discussion about another
topic earlier, is that, why, Lee you tell me this, I'm going to
[indecipherable] now, why are we such a book bound culture?

[10:48] I just taught two courses back to back without a book and they
were phenomenally successful, students loved it, highest ratings ever
had, but every time I was going to do that, two times that I this, my
colleagues go, "What text book are you going to use?" I go, "I'm not
going to use one," They go, "What?"

[11:04] Publishers have this model of a textbook with other things
around, so when we did...I won't say who it is, but a particular
publisher we work with, we wrote this fabulous movie and what we wanted
was a movie for the textbook.

[11:20] By the time we got in the contraction, negotiation,
everything, the publisher had turned into a textbook with a movie and
there are adopters out there who actually don't even use the movie with
the textbook and we are going, "What?"

**Stacey**:  [11:32] That's the text...

**Bill**:  [11:34] That's the whole point of having this wonderful,
lots of input, something to talk about. I tell people like "OK Lee, did
you watch Letterman last night, or did you watch Family Guy last night?"
"Oh yeah, that was the best episode." We do that. Same thing with the
movie, "Oh I loved that, did you see what happened when...?"

[11:51] You know, you got something to talk about because that's what
we do.

**Stacey**:  [11:56] You actually said that you think all hybrid
instruction has to be local, which I think ties into the textbook thing,
people don't develop their own hybrid instruction because they're
depending on that, that outside publisher‑based resource.

**Lee**:  [12:09] I think it's possible but, I think like Bill was
saying, there's just...It feels like a lot of teachers aren't educated.
One thing ‑‑ and I'm going to talk about it in a couple of days about
choosing textbooks ‑‑ is that instructors should analyze, actually go
through the materials that are the online, and ask themselves every
point, "What is the student doing and why are they doing it?"

[12:28] Ask these questions, "Are they actually communicating? Is
there any creativity involved?" It's something that Bill's talked about
a lot is, are they demonstrating comprehension at all points, these
things?"

[12:38] I think if you do that you'll rapidly find that there's really
not much going on, and this is why the students feel it busy work, it's
not connected to the real lives, they don't see any of their own skills
developed.

[12:47] It's hard then. I think something commercially has to be
available, because otherwise you have to be a large school with enough
money to pay for a team of several people to create these things.

[12:57] What happens to the community colleges, the high schools, the
less endowed state universities, they don't have those resources. I
think there's space, actually, of course I believe there's space, for
smaller publishers that aren't a part of the big four of five to
actually intervene here and create some stuff that can be used, or
adapted. Could be localized even if it's not local somewhere else.

**Bill**:  [13:16] One thing we've done is we've made our materials
available, people who adopt this book, which is obviously one of my
books, we've given those materials away for them, I gave all the online
materials that we have, if they want to hybridize, or they want them in
addition to not hybridizing, just because they want good quality outside
materials.

[13:34] They're input oriented, they're meaning based, students can
just click on this and just get, I mean, you have to actually think your
way through and actually do the work. There's a number of institutions
that actually use it, we just gave it away...

**Lee**:  [13:50] I've heard from one of the large publishers, someone
that works for them, that there is a move away from textbooks. That they
are not actually going to make physical books. Of course, the next
nightmare for the next 10 years is electronic versions of the same
format of all paper textbooks, which is even worse then, because the
affordances of a book in class aren't there, but maybe we'll move beyond
it.

[14:09] A lot of it, I think, it's driven not necessarily by
publishers, it's driven by students. In my experience in the last 10
years, they want security, students feel unsure if they can't calculate
answers, very focused on accuracy, even if instructors don't want to be
that.

[14:25] Sometimes the students are the ones that want closing things
so that they can get out of the way and get on with their lives, kind of
force, almost push, for these less meaningful interactions.

**Stacey**:  [14:35] For me this isn't an EdTech problem, how is our
EdTech so disconnected from actual teaching and learning, and it's the
student perception or is it that our EdTech isn't working?

**Lee**:  [14:47] In my limited experience, the first problem that's
changed for me in that is that the students aren't making connections
that I feel like they used to make, or perhaps I was even oblivious to
before. I think across the board I'm finding myself needing to draw for
everything we do in class, why we're doing it.

[15:02] That students don't really intuit, why this we're doing this
and maybe we can say that they're maturing and they're less happy with
just being handed stuff to do that they don't understand. They're
demanding more part...

**Stacey**:  [15:12] More sophisticated...

**Lee**:  [15:13] More sophistication, or "Show me why this is
important." Sometimes, for instance, I'll have them do things out of
class that are totally related to in class, but they don't make the
connection as easily as I do. It may not just be the materials, it may
just be an instructor or us as teachers trying to demonstrate to these
students how it all fits together.

**Bill**:  [15:33] One of the things we've done, we've encouraged
instructors to do...Because I can't obligate them to do this because
we're not experiencing that problem, the disconnect, because the
flow...We wrote the materials, so that was built into the flow from
outside to in class.

[15:49] What some instructors do when the students first get there, is
they borrow one of those online activities as the warm‑up for class and
so the students go "I did this last time, I remember this now." and then
naturally segues into the first thing they want to do in class as part
of the task building they're doing...

[16:03] Students may [indecipherable] the connection because they
see how that thing is leading to this thing here. Those of you who
aren't watching, I'm moving my hands like this back and forth, to show
the lead from right to the left.

[16:14] [laughter]

**Bill**:  [16:15] Who can talk without hands, right?

**Stacey**:  [16:17] This should be a video podcast.

**Lee**:  [16:18] That's very good. I've been working with the
[indecipherable] statements, like you and Walter have been doing, and
when I have them do practice outside the class they see how it connects,
they feel a lot more fluid, because they know what they've been
training. More practice outside the class is then affirmed, and
re‑enforced, and validated in class.

**Bill**:  [16:36] There's two things also that tie into this whole ‑‑
it's part of the EdTech thing, but it's part of language teaching more
generally ‑‑ is until instructors can see other ways of assigning grades
and assessing students, you're not going to have much change. Because as
long as people are bound to a textbook, then you test the content of
that textbook so what do you wind up testing? The things you can test.

[17:02] What do you need for that test, and then your textbook wind up
looking the way...I mean, it's a vicious cycle within the textbook and
it has some [indecipherable] . One of the things we did, we got rid of
tests.

[17:12] That's helped a lot. The problem we have is, I don't know if
you've experienced this, we have people coming in to the second year
[indecipherable] from high school, or someplace else and they're
literally like WTF on their evaluation on this mess, "Well I didn't
learn anything in this course. I learned no new tenses, why don't we
have any worksheets?" I'm like "OK."

[17:37] The good teachers don't get that, because teachers who don't
know how to communicate why we do it, that's when I see those in
evaluations. We never get that in the first year, because you get them
fresh, and the people teaching the first year know how to communicate
that stuff.

[17:54] It's the people coming in, and you can see on the evaluation
forms, who has Spanish with us the first year, and who's coming in. You
can see it on the evaluations.

[18:07] They're used to paper and pencil tests. I'm going to get a law
degree, so I need to get an A, I need to get a 4.0so I need to show some
knowledge and those kind of things. That then feeds back in the EdTech
part, because what helps you take a test? Outside activities that help
you take a test.

**Stacey**:  [18:23] In a perfect world where big textbook publishers
aren't going to alter your content, where you'll get the supplements
that you really want, you're not too tired at the end of the book
writing process to create the perfect supplements. Everything goes the
way you think it should.

[18:40] What would a first or second year language textbook, what
would that online or electronic component do for students? What would it
look like, and how would students interact with that?

**Lee**:  [18:50] Hopefully we're at the beginning of a new era in
that way of trying to figure it out. I think the first thing comes with
getting rid of that idea of textbooks. It's its own genre.

[19:01] They all look the same, they all have rules of what's true and
what's not, what has to be in there, the 30 page introduction for
instructors to leaf through to see if it's going to cover preterit in
the second semester or not, and these other checkpoints.

[19:13] Getting rid of that is very disconcerting to both students and
teachers. I had a program that adopted Auf Geht's! Right when it came
out. The lead instructor was very excited, very communicative and such.
Then these two German teachers that taught with him took a look at it,
and uttered in dismay, "This isn't a textbook," which meant to them we
can't use it.

[19:34] The question is whether this actually helps them learn German,
not this isn't a textbook. We have to keep moving away from this idea of
this monolithic textbook. I don't even know what else to call the next
thing, language learning materials? I don't know. There's not an easy
word for it.

[19:50] I think it's going to involve, like Bill has said, students
demonstrating comprehension as much as possible. I think you should
include a lot of authentic audio. I've been a big proponent of that. I
have a lot of good reasons to do that in order to lower, if you want to
call the effective filter, at least student's nervousness in listening
to real native speakers, or speaking to them.

[20:09] They need a lot more input than they get just in the class
time, and they're not the biggest readers, so I think it needs to be
lots of video, lots of listening. While I'm a big proponent of
authentic, it has to be also very comprehensible to. There has to be a
good mix.

[20:22] That's going to look very different. Students might be taken
aback a bit, because it takes time. It takes time to listen to stuff. It
takes time to interact with materials, and they are pretty busy. I think
that's one of the problems, to make these materials more effective,
we're going to have to find ways to have the students spend more time
doing it and not be angry.

**Bill**:  [20:43] In my ideal world, you work backwards and you go,
"OK, what are going to wind up doing in class? What's that going to look
like?" Then that's going to dictate to us was going to happen outside of
the class. In my ideal world, of course I'm task driven. I like tasks to
frame each and every class, if possible.

[21:02] Let's say on Friday this week, we're going to do this one task
where the outcome of the unit. In fact, I talk about this in my new book
that's coming out with [indecipherable] in November. Let's say the
unit is called, "What did we do last night, and what does that say about
us?"

[21:25] At the end of that week, we're going to do a task that Jim
Leah and I have called, "Sedentary or active," where you get information
from people about what they did last night, and then you share
information about yourself, and so on.

[21:40] Then you find out how sedentary or active people are based on
that, and you compare yourself to a national nor. You're actually
learning something, there is some critical thinking along the way, and
so on. Then there's mini tasks that you do along the way.

[21:52] For example, one mini task that you do the day before would
involve cell phone usage. You talk about, how connected where you last
night? How much time did you spend on your cell phone? Were you on
Facebook, or on chat? What were you doing?

[22:06] All this feeds into this idea of, what did you do last night?
What does this tells us about ourselves? When you work backwards from
those, those are going to be your tasks. Every day, you are doing a task
like that. What are you doing outside of class, to prepare you for that
task?

[22:19] Then that's what needs to happen online. You need to hear
people talking about what they did last night, and then you need to do
things like grade them on a scale after you hear them, or you need two
people talk, and you compare them and say, "Which of these following
statements is true? This person is more connected than that person, true
or false?"

[22:38] All of those kinds of things will feed into what you're going
to wind up doing in class, both in terms of the content, and in terms of
any vocabulary you might need, or functions you might need. That's what
I think should happen.

[22:55] I think materials, both in class and out of class, don't need
to be print. In fact, they shouldn't be print. Walter and I are now
moving toward a system by which you're going to be evaluated. We're
changing our evaluation form. We're adding a new question on there for
the TAs and the instructors when we observe them.

[23:15] One of the questions we're going to have is, does the teacher
minimize the use of textbook in class? We actually have some teachers
already. You go and observe them, or they turn their videos in to me to
watch, and you never see a single textbook open. Everything's on a
screen, which has all their faces up, and they interact with each other
instead of having their faces down.

[23:33] I think that's what we need. We need more of that, because
textbooks get in the way of interaction.

**Lee**:  [23:38] I'm sort of semi to where Bill is. I still see a use
for print, whether it's in a book or not, but it's a lot less than it
was before. I don't think that bringing this huge textbook with all the
grammar explanations, there's nothing necessary about that. Some of my
own activities in the books I do are done outside of class to prepare
class for interactions done in the text itself.

[23:57] That's something that could be handled in hand‑outs as well,
if you think print is a better use, if it keeps students focused. I
think now screens are ubiquitous. Even a few years ago they weren't, but
it seems now you can pretty much count on there being some way to
display information visually to a whole class.

[24:14] That's making me rethink my own materials, because half of it
is that. You can just display this on a thing. I think next versions of
my book are going to be a lot thinner, even if they don't totally
disappear and go electronic, for that very reason. I think that's the
way things are moving.

**Bill**:  [24:27] I taught a third year conversation course with no
book. I used "Pan's Labyrinth" as the "text." I divided it up into seven
segments, and I created seven two‑week units around these segments. I
created all the materials myself, they went up online and we used D2L,
Desire2Learn.

[24:46] All the stuff they needed was there. All the activities
prepared them for class. Then I had in‑class tasks we did, and then once
every two weeks we had movie day where they watched the movie outside of
class, and did different things with the segment, but then we re‑watched
it in class. By the time they saw it in class, they were seeing it for
like the fifth time. Talk about input.

[25:06] [laughter]

**Bill**:  [25:07] Then we would stop and do things. One of the things
I got from the students was, "Thank God there was no textbook. Because
one, you saved me money, and two, I didn't have to lug anything around."
There was a conversation class, but I made them do little, mini writing
tasks, too.

[25:28] Not a problem. Between an iPad or a laptop there wasn't a
single student who wasn't prepared to go. Now, that's Michigan State,
but we're not a rich school. We're just a state school. We have a lot of
students who are still first time goers to Michigan State. We have some
who aren't, obviously.

[25:44] It might be harder in some schools to do that, but I can do
that. That's why I say, a lot of stuff is local. Decisions you make
about stuff sometimes is locally dictated. I do it myself before I give
it to a publisher, for a variety of reasons. I don't want them to change
the content.

[25:58] When you try to sell...have you ever seen a conversation book?
I don't understand the concept of a conversation book. It's an oxymoron
to me. What you've got to do is get out there start leading the ground
work.

[26:12] Next year, I'll start presenting this course, for example.
Maybe present it, and then maybe put the materials out there for people
who want to learn how to do this. How do you teach a course without a
book? Here's how you do it.

**Lee**:  [26:28] I would jump in and say they should take Bill's
approach. This is why we should get rid of textbooks, or at least that
word textbook, because it gives to somebody else both the power and the
responsibility to create my course. What Bill has talked about here is
creating his own course. He wants to do it around Pan's Labyrinth, so he
put it together. He took the time and he did it.

[26:47] More of us need to do that. As we do it with open resources,
and share it, I think we can swap it around with some other people. You
don't need a publisher to do that.

[26:56] As long as an instructor's willing to except that it doesn't
have all the bells and whistles of these big course management
platforms, which by the way are the things that are jacking up the cost
of these things because they're mega billions to develop.

[27:08] It's stopping development at the lower levels. If all of these
instructors expect these bells and whistles and everything, then it's
only going to be the major publishers that even have the money to put
these things out.

**Stacey**:  [27:18] If a teacher says, "I don't have the experience,
knowledge, or confidence to build my course from the ground up," how
would you respond to that?

**Bill**:  [27:28] Everybody can. You just need to be encouraged. I
don't think there's a single person at this conference, for example, who
couldn't do something and do it decently. It may not be excellent, but
the conversation course, actually it wasn't the best online stuff, but
it was decent.

[27:45] It was a solid course. It got super high evaluations from the
students. I know it could be better, but the time constraints I had,
this is what I did. Now when I teach it again, just next year, I'm going
to go back in before and ask someone. By the time I teach it the third
time, it will be what I want it to be.

[28:01] That's OK. Sometimes people need permission. It's OK to be
good enough when you start. The world isn't going to end if you're good
enough, but think of the alternative of doing nothing. Start somewhere
and just do it. I don't think there's a person who can't do something,
if you just show them a little bit how. God, the resources online, right
Lee?

**Lee**:  [28:25] Huge.

**Bill**:  [28:25] You just Google how to do X and you can find on
Google how to do something. How do I do this on a platform? Universities
everywhere have workshops and tech people who are dying to help you, and
they're interested in this kind of stuff.

[28:39] They go, "We've never had a language person come here and ask,
so this is kind of interesting." You can do it. Sometimes people need
permission, too. We've been doing this since the mid '90s, I've been
doing this since the mid '90s, and everything I teach has a component
like this.

[28:56] Whether it's the language program I direct, the courses I
teach, whatever. Yeah, technology has a glitch now and then and you just
go, "OK, so what? That's life."

**Lee**:  [29:12] I just repeat what I said before. I think there's
lots of good uses for technology out there. You can get a very
acceptable version just putting materials together yourself and linking
them to a simple blog. You don't have to go through a publisher's thing.

[29:26] That adds a lot of costs. I would encourage everyone, if you
want to use publisher materials, don't just assume students are
practicing outside class because there's this online platform and ignore
it. You need to get into it yourself, see how it works, see where
they're learning, see what's frustrating and then evaluate whether it's
something you want to use or not.

**Bill**:  [29:42] You also have to put the incentive into the course
itself. The outside work for our class is 25 percent of your final
grade, because it is a hybrid flip. There's one hour gone, so that one
hour was 25 percent of the course. That 25 percent of the grade is
posted outside of class. Not a problem, students do it.

**Stacey**:  [30:02] Another thing that I think I've gotten from this
conversation is that the textbook publishers are not the experts.
Teachers have permission to believe that they're the experts on their
own course, and they can design their own materials. They don't have to
rely on someone else's technology, they can go ahead and build it
themselves.

[30:18] It may not be great the first time, but that's OK.

**Lee**:  [30:22] If the instructors are the ones who are consciously
setting the objectives and goals for their course, and they're deciding
whether these print published materials assist them or not, that's
already a huge step. Instead of just assuming this is first‑year
language, I need a first‑year textbook, and learning what's in it, and
just doing it.

**Stacey**:  [30:40] Any other technologies that you're using in your
class?

**Bill**:  [30:43] Absolutely. I use Google Classroom for example for
group writing activities I do. There's other things that we use to
maximize stuff.

**Lee**:  [30:54] I've used Kaizena for assessing student writing
which is a site that allows you to give feedback a little bit more
detailed than Google Docs.

**Bill**:  [31:03] We used Eli for a while. I love Eli and all of the
guys at MSU who developed Eli, but it's really geared towards typical
rhetoric and composition courses for native speakers of English. We've
adapted to our needs but the problem it has is the teacher can't go in.
It's supposed to be student only interaction. They're big on peer and
which I agree with.

[31:25] We do do that, but then at some point the teacher needs to
insert him or herself and tell the class or tell others, "I think you
missed the point here that this is not a good opening sentence for this
essay you are writing." The teacher can't do that.

[31:39] We experimented. Dan experimented with Google Classroom and in
his 202 course, fourth semester course and I experimented with it in my
conversation course. It works quite well because then I can go in and
say everything and I get my own comments, other comments are in there
which for group writing because they are all...

[31:55] When I switched from individual writing to group writing this
semester which was a fabulous decision by the way, one person was in
charge of opening the document. The other person would log on away and
then they could type stuff in. It was great. Those kinds of technologies
will work really well in class I think so.

**Stacey**:  [32:10] The last question that we ask everyone on the
podcast is what is your favorite analog educational technology?

**Lee**:  [32:22] I've used PLAYMOBIL with good success in class.

**Stacey**:  [32:27] The toys? [laughs]

**Lee**:  [32:29] The toys yeah. If we're working on prepositions or
verbs, I'll have them create things out of PLAYMOBIL castle sets, other
things that I bring along with me and then describe what they are doing.

[32:40] [background music]

**Stacey**:  [32:41] Derek I loved the answer that Lee gave there. I
don't think we're going to get another guest on this podcast who
mentions toys as their favorite analog technology, but I think it's a
good idea. Toys are fun, they're engaging and when the teacher walks
into a classroom with an arm full of toys I think students will
definitely be curious about what is in store for them in this class.

**Derek**:  [33:04] I would think so. I can't remember the last time
I've used a lot of toys in class, but I do manage to work in board games
from time to time. I'm a big board game fan. I start my linear algebra
course by handing out photocopies of a Monopoly board and I ask students
to analyze what strategy there is in a game.

[33:20] As it turns out, there's a good piece of Monopoly that you can
model using some techniques from linear algebra, so it's a nice kind of
introduction to what you can do with linear algebra in, what I think, is
a kind of accessible way. Just last week in my statistics course I used
a couple of other more interesting board games to talk about basic
concept in probability.

**Stacey**:  [33:37] I would really want to stay for the rest of your
linear algebra class if we did board games on the first day.

**Derek**:  [33:43] Well thanks. I try to get folks interested in kind
of what you can do with linear algebra right from day one. We do go over
the syllabus eventually...

**Stacey**:  [33:51] Details.

**Derek**:  [33:53] Detail. Our guests this episode were Lee Forester
of Hope College and Bill VanPatten from Michigan State University. You
can read more about both guests and their work by following the links in
the show notes.

[34:04] Speaking of links Stacey has more to share on this topic of
digital textbooks. Can you tell us about the resources you've put
together?

**Stacey**:  [34:13] I'm happy to. As you mentioned I'm the Assistant
Director for Educational Technology here and I'm really interested in
learning platforms and what they can do so I put together a teaching
guide. Here at the Center for Teaching at Vanderbilt we have an
extensive collection of what we call teaching guides.

[34:28] As part of my work on this episode I put together a collection
of resources that are words of wisdom from other faculty members about
how to make good use of publishers' online learning platforms. I hope it
will be useful to others. It was really interesting for me to put
together and that resource is available to anyone who'd like to access
it on our website, cft.vanderbilt.edu.

**Derek**:  [34:53] Great and we'll have a link to that in our show
notes. Thank you, Stacey, for those resources and for taking the lead on
the interview in this episode.

**Stacey**:  [35:01] It was my pleasure.
