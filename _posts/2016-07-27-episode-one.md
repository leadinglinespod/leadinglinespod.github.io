George Siemens is executive director of the Learning Innovation and Networked Knowledge Research Lab at the University of Texas at Arlington. He is an internationally known expert in digital, networked, and open learning. Among his other accomplishments, he co-taught the very first massive open online courses (known as MOOCs) back in 2008. His “connectivist” MOOCs featured peer-to-peer learning through blogs, Twitter, and other platforms. These days, George continues to lead research efforts into MOOCs and other forms of digital learning.

George was on campus at Vanderbilt in the spring to give a talk as part of the Schmidt Family Educational Technologies Lecture series, and he was kind enough to sit down to talk about the present and future of educational technology. We’re honored to have him as our first guest on Leading Lines.

 Derek Bruff: \[00:05\] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
 Vanderbilt University. I'm your host Derek Bruff, Director of the
 Vanderbilt Center for Teaching.

 \[00:13\] In this podcast we explore creative, intentional and
 effective uses of technology to enhance student learning, uses that
 point the way to the future of educational technology in college and
 university settings. Through interviews with educators, researchers,
 technologists and others, we hope to amplify ideas and voices that are
 or should be shaping how we think about digital learning and digital
 pedagogy.

 \[00:34\] In this episode, I interview George Siemens, Executive
 Director of the Learning Innovation and Networked Knowledge and
 Research Lab at the University of Texas at Arlington.

 \[00:42\] George is an internationally known expert in digital
 networked and open learning. Among his other accomplishments, he
 co-taught the very first Massive Open Online Courses, commonly known
 as MOOCs, back in 2008. His connectivist MOOCs, featured peer-to-peer
 learning through blogs, Twitter, and other platforms.

 \[00:59\] These days, George continues to lead research efforts into
 MOOCs and other forms of digital learning.

 \[01:05\] George was on campus at Vanderbilt in the spring to give a
 talk, as part of the Schmidt Family Educational Technologies Lecture
 series, and he was kind enough to sit down with me for a little while
 to talk about the present and future of educational technology.

 \[01:17\] George has a way of thinking and talking about technology
 that helps me step back and appreciate the big picture, and we're
 honored to have him as our first guest on Leading Lines.

 \[01:26\] \[music\]

 Derek: \[01:28\] I'm going to start with the big question, but it's
 one that I know you've thought about. Let's get out our crystal balls
 a little bit. Given the work that you're doing now, what do you see
 for the future of colleges and universities, particularly as
 technology shapes that future?

 George Siemens: \[01:43\] I think, in a lot of ways, they'll continue
 to exist. I know there's been a lot of narrative that has come in a
 number of circles about universities are dying or in the future we're
 going to see half as many universities. I think theorists like
 Christensen and others have made some really strong statements about
 that.

 \[02:00\] I just think there's absolutely no evidence that supports
 those opinions. Currently, if you look at major, developing regions of
 the world, they're putting much more dollars into the existing
 university system rather than actually pulling back.

 \[02:13\] One example recently with Saudi Arabia, they've announced
 something in the range of a \$2 trillion innovation fund, or future
 economic fund, recognizing that eventually their oil source will dry
 up. A big part of that is obviously focused on university. Their King
 Abdullah University of Science and Technology was created to the tune
 of \$30 billion to try to bridge the knowledge economy.

 \[02:35\] Same thing with China. Massive, massive investments in the
 future of their university system. To start, I just want to emphasize
 that that's not changing. Universities are going to be here in the
 future. There likely will be a few systems here and there that will
 close or that will smaller systems might not be successful, or
 whatever else comes of that at an individual level.

 \[02:58\] By and large, the idea of universities as the knowledge back
 bone of a society, as an innovation back bone of a society, I don't
 expect that that's going to change in the next 15 to 20 years.

 \[03:10\] I do think it will be augmented. It will be augmented by
 range of other knowledge providers such as, let's say, code academies,
 or these boot camps to help people get skilled to work in a particular
 sector. That may come up as something that will grow an influence, but
 that is really reflective of the demographic shifts.

 \[03:29\] Let's just say hypothetically, 50 years ago we needed, let's
 say, 15,000 hours of learning to enter a solid degree. Nowadays, it's
 doubled and tripled because we have to learn constantly.

 \[03:42\] If you are somebody who is a programmer working for
 Facebook, you're constantly having to learn and update your skills and
 learn new approaches, new methods, new models of the work that you are
 doing.

 \[03:52\] The same holds true in all areas of society, we just need to
 learn more and learn more constantly than we ever have. From that end,
 there's an expansion of the learning pie, so to speak, even though
 there's a number of providers that are adding on that we didn't have
 before.

 \[04:07\] A simple view, in my case, is that in the future we are
 going to see more, not less, of involvement of university systems in
 our lives. That may take a different form. There may be more of a
 blended approach, there may be more of a partly online or fully online
 even, but still linked back to university identity.

 \[04:24\] In one way, I have described it in the past, is that where
 as we may have, a generation ago, had a four year relationship with a
 university, in the future we are going to have something along the
 lines of a 40-year relationship where we keep returning to the
 university to re-skill and upgrade back to the labor market, back to
 the university, back to the labor market.

 Derek: \[04:42\] Will there come a day where we don't have courses or
 classrooms?

 George: \[04:47\] That's a really interesting question. I don't know.
 I think there will be a day where we don't have exclusively courses,
 and we don't have exclusively classrooms.

 \[04:56\] I think it's possible that, for example, as I'm involved in
 working, of course my job, education, I have something that looks like
 a personal learning graph that details what I know and how I have come
 to know it, and has some way of me communicating my capability back to
 an employer, or to a perspective employer.

 \[05:17\] Then I may need to go to a university to gap fill some of
 those areas and that maybe not delivered through the existing
 pre-structured program or course. It may end up being something that
 looks much more like a computed curriculum, meaning that it's
 addressed real time for me.

 \[05:35\] This idea of personalized and adaptive learning is that I
 attend a campus and I'm provided the curriculum that addresses the
 knowledge gaps that I have in order for me to get that degree.

 \[05:44\] I might not have to take a two-year certificate in two
 years. I may be able to complete that in three months if it accounts
 for what I've already learned based on this knowledge graph that I
 built while I was working, while I was volunteering, and so on.

 \[05:56\] It's possible you don't have that, but even now, if you look
 at it, how long haven't we been able to meet online for events and
 conferences and so on? Yet, the conference circuit, if anything, has
 exploded. There's more conferences every year. You'd say, "Well yeah,
 but I could just as soon watch that online or I could just as soon do
 whatever," and we do a lot of that.

 \[06:16\] It's not that we don't watch YouTube, or TEDTalk, or
 instructional videos online. Instead, what it is that we're doing
 that, but still meeting as we traditionally are.

 \[06:26\] I think the future and one of the interesting aspects of
 technology is it's almost always additive. We like to think it
 replaces. We talk like it replaces, but look to your university IT
 department. If you have an LMS and somebody comes along and says, "We
 should do ePortfolios," you don't do an LMS or ePortfolios, you do an
 LMS and ePortfolio.

 \[06:43\] Then someone says, "Oh, we should do something like a Domain
 of One's Own, or everybody should have their own blog." Well, now
 you're going to have an LMS, an ePortfolio, and blogs added on. Then
 someone will come by and say, "We'll use an adaptive learning system."
 That's the component of technology. It's highly additive.

 \[06:59\] I think, in the same regard, we will still have courses, but
 we also have the range of additional approaches and ways of helping
 students learn that's more relevant to their life context and their
 personal learning needs at that time.

 Derek: \[07:12\] Given some of those possibilities on the horizon,
 what would you like to see happen in educational technology in, say,
 the next three years?

 George: \[07:20\] My big research interest right now is on social and
 affect. With the Research Lab, the focus that I have and that the
 researchers have is what does it mean to be human in a digital age?
 That's really our driving question. What happens to the human in this
 experience?

 \[07:38\] I think this is relevant because we're hearing these rumors,
 these murmurings of how society is going to change due to automated
 technologies. One example I recently read looked at the 3.5 million
 truck drivers in the US could be obsolete within 5 to 10 years because
 of self-driving trucks. You don't need people driving it. That's an
 enormous impact on the economy.

 \[08:01\] To have a truck driving job, which is reasonably well-paying
 -- my dad was actually a truck driver and a reasonably well-paying
 type of work -- to have that all be gone and automated, that has
 interesting implications in terms of what our learning needs are going
 to be and what society looks like.

 \[08:18\] From that end, my short-term and, I'd say, long-term
 question is, "What becomes of the human in the midst of these
 upheavals?" If we see and continue to hear about Google being able to
 beat the world Go champion, or IBM when Watson won Jeopardy, and these
 other kinds of innovations that we see from AI. I'm starting to
 wonder, "What does that mean to us?"

 \[08:43\] From an educational technology...and there's a few trends
 that are significant now. I don't know if they're going to be
 sustainable of what I would call alpha trends. Alpha trends are the
 ones that re-orient the whole field or an entire way of thinking.
 Whereas a lot of secondary trends that are there, they make an impact
 and they change what we do as practices, but they don't necessarily
 completely alter everything.

 \[09:03\] For a while there, everybody was talking about MOOCs like
 they were this big new thing that was going to change the university.
 People like Clay Shirky wrote that MOOCs are the mp3 moment in higher
 education, and Udacity, which was at that time...they're now a
 corporate learning provider, but at that time they were the early MOOC
 providers, and that Udacity was going to be our Napster. There was a
 lot of people making a hugely bold proclamations.

 \[09:26\] Now you look at it and say, "Well, MOOCs are terrific.
 They're relevant. They're useful, but they're not an alpha trend."
 They're not changing the conversation the way that people predictably
 would.

 \[09:36\] Competency-based education. I don't know if that's going to
 be something that's going to change everything. It'll be something
 that'll have an impact. Now we're hearing about blockchain as an
 assessment or as a credentialing type of a model.

 Derek: \[09:49\] What is blockchain?

 George: \[09:50\] \[laughs\] That's a really good question.
 Blockchain, basically -- and there's a recent post that Audrey
 Waterside did on addressing this. It's basically, for lack of a
 better, a ledger. It's a way of keeping track of something that's
 happening. It was developed in tight conjunction, or at least it
 flowed out of Bitcoin. Not flowing out. It was central to Bitcoin.

 \[10:11\] The idea of this, everything that happens to this
 transaction is encoded and it can't be changed. It's a permanent
 non-changeable entity, which means that you have greater trust in it
 because you can see everything that's happened to this.

 \[10:24\] That idea of a blockchain, namely the series of links and
 connections. It's a ledger, everything that's happened to a something.
 It could be a currency. It could be a bank transaction. It could be a
 learning pathway and so on, or the learning that I've done.

 \[10:37\] The whole system, the integrity is within the system. You
 can't just change one part of the system without the rest of the
 system being influenced by this. That's, I think, essentially one way
 that people who've looked at badging are starting to think, "Well
 maybe this way of the blockchain idea as a credentialing approach,
 could have some potential interest."

 \[10:56\] All these things coming up, whether we're talking mobiles,
 we're talking wearables, we're talking competency learning, we're
 talking personalized and adaptive learning. There's this enormous
 range of new ways of looking at teaching and learning and education.

 \[11:10\] I think anyone who picks the winner, at this point, is
 lucky. We really don't know which trends will stick, which ones are
 going to be consequential, which ones are going to be short term
 passing trends. Even a few years ago it was digital badges were going
 to change everything. They might still, but you don't hear much about
 digital badges anymore, as learning and crediting approach that we
 were hearing even two years ago.

 Derek: \[11:33\] I have to say, I'm typically skeptical of the "It's
 going to change everything," argument. I remember the days of Second
 Life and how, somehow this virtual reality was going to change how we
 do universities. When you look back at it, it was kind of useful here
 and there, but it was enormously resource intensive. It didn't scale
 in the way that would actually effect any kind of change.

 \[11:56\] I do think about characteristics of technologies or trends
 that are likely to have a bigger impact or lesser impact. A lot of my
 work is in teaching with clickers, which I have seen used in all
 disciplines, in all classroom settings.

 \[12:12\] That's something it has going for it and that it seems
 adaptable enough, that you can see some widespread use. Is everyone
 going to be teaching with clickers? No, that hasn't happened. We've
 hit about 10 percent faculty adoption, maybe we'll hit 15 one day, but
 it's not transforming how we do classroom learning.

 \[12:31\] It's useful and it's interesting. I think a lot of these
 trends will have uses and will be interesting in different ways.

 George: \[12:38\] I absolutely agree. The mention of technology as an
 additive agent, I think is something that's worth considering which
 just means we have more options.

 \[12:48\] We really are in the age of choice. It's not just that we
 have 10 channels on TV that we're dealing with, it's we have 500. To
 add to that 500, we have Netflix and then we have iTunes or a range of
 other sources of watching videos, and HULU. It's really the age of
 choice.

 \[13:09\] That diversification of options is becoming more evident in
 education, not just from choices for how we teach, though there's many
 of those there. We can use an LMS. We can use a classroom. We can go
 blended. We can use clickers. We can use adaptive software. We can use
 blogs. There's a huge range of options.

 \[13:28\] From a student end it's, faculty member, she lectured about
 the Stanford prison experiment. Rather than reading it in a text, you
 can go on to YouTube and actually see an interview with the research
 leads and some of the participants in the Stanford prison experiment.
 We have this huge range of teaching and learning options that we
 didn't have in the past.

 \[13:50\] Recent report at MIT addressed this as well, one of the top
 uses of the MOOCs that they were running, was actually for their own
 campus students to revisit lectures that they had, maybe not fully
 understood in class or there were some practice activities that were
 sometimes involved with some of the Computer Science courses, they can
 engage in those activities.

 \[14:07\] It's this broadening of options and growing range of
 interests, matching our educational options, teaching and learning to
 the general explosion of options we have in other areas of our lives.

 Derek: \[14:18\] Let me ask about one of those option sets. I know
 it's one that you've looked at, and that's learning analytics. I hear
 a lot about learning analytics and their potential to enhance teaching
 and learning.

 \[14:31\] I sometimes think maybe I hear too much. There's a lot of
 noise. What's the signal there? First, what are learning analytics, as
 you think of them, and what kind of potential do you see in their
 future in higher education?

 George: \[14:47\] Learning analytics, largely, is the use of data that
 we have available to us about students and their learning process and
 activities, in order to improve the effectiveness and the quality of
 their learning experiences.

 \[15:00\] Trying a simpler way, it's using data to improve the success
 of learners. Now, as with anything else, once you have a few corporate
 partners that are interested in it, you're not going to read an
 article or pick up a whatever, a newspaper. If it says, "Here's a
 moderated view of how learning analytics may help," that's not going
 to sell.

 \[15:22\] On the other hand, if you say, "All faculty will be obsolete
 in 20 years, says researchers," somebody will pick up that article
 because it's provocative. It's click bait, but in the newspaper form.
 That's the same problem we have with learning analytics.

 \[15:36\] Learning analytics aren't going to change the education
 system 100 percent. But they're going to impact every part of the
 education system. It'll impact how we recruit students. It'll impact
 how we teach in a classroom setting. It'll impact how students get
 feedback. It'll impact how we assign resources within an existing
 university setting, and so on.

 \[15:56\] A few quick examples of what that might look like. Through
 the use of learning analytics, probably one of the first things that's
 gained a lot of attention is predictive models for student dropouts.
 If there's indication that a student might dropout, do we have the
 ability to recognize that and provide support services before they
 actually drop out? That's an easy approach.

 \[16:16\] More complex approaches are that of adaptive learning, where
 we would say to each student, this is your level of knowledge of this
 course. We can adapt the content either in terms of pace, flow, type
 of content, type of social interactions based on how the student is
 succeeding.

 \[16:30\] If you show that you're mastering concepts quickly, you get
 moved to a more advanced level quickly. If you show some difficulty,
 let's say in a course that indicates, George hasn't mastered basic
 math concepts that we would expect a student at this level to have. It
 would regress me, if you will, back to basic math instruction so it
 could build my foundation for future learning.

 \[16:52\] There's been other activities with and around recommender
 systems. Recommender systems can be social. George you should learn
 with Derek because he's a bright guy and he can help you learn better.
 He's mastered this concept and could serve as a good student or peer
 mentor.

 \[17:06\] There's also been content recommendation systems that have
 been used in this, where this is the course you should take next. If
 you take this other course next, there's a better chance, or a higher
 chance of you failing so this is what we recommend.

 \[17:17\] Learning analytics has, I think, the capability to make an
 impact on all parts of the system by making all agents functioning
 within a system more aware of what's actually happening.

 \[17:29\] Beyond that, I think it's worth emphasizing their future is
 not necessarily one of completely altering everything, but it is one
 that I think it will influence how teachers make teaching decisions.
 It'll influence how students develop their self-regulation skills
 because a big part of this idea of the quantified self.

 \[17:47\] This is reflected with wearable devices. We already see
 Fitbits and calorie intake or apps and so on. If we have better
 information about ourselves, there's the prospect then, not the
 guarantee but there's the prospect that we're going to do a better job
 of self-regulating.

 \[18:04\] From a learning end, me, for example, as a learner, aware of
 how I'm doing and what I'm doing may give me the tools to change my
 practices or my strategies when I'm involved in learning so it's just
 bringing education up to speed with what's happening in other sectors
 of society around the use of data.

 Derek: \[18:24\] Are there concerns about learning analytics that we
 should keep in mind? Things that might make us move more cautiously in
 certain directions?

 George: \[18:31\] The biggest concern I have is around making the
 education process soulless. You can't engineer learning the way that
 you can engineer a building. Learning is a social complex process and
 I'm concerned that our algorithmic approaches to it will end up
 sucking the soul out of it and it'll become this lifeless passionless
 experience where we're just clicking the next button to get the next
 knowledge nugget.

 \[18:56\] That's my biggest concern. I have secondary concerns around
 privacy and ethics. Who has access to the data? Especially with more
 corporations now involved in the university sector, who's going to get
 access to that data and what are they going to do with it?

 \[19:08\] So I do definitely have some of those considerations and
 concerns as well, but by and large it's about if we are committed to
 analytics we need to take the idea of analytics and apply it to our
 analytics.

 \[19:21\] Meaning that we need to assess whether they're working the
 way that we said they would, whether we are getting the results that
 we expected we would get and if we're not then to revisit the ideas
 that we have. Maybe we find that this data intensive model doesn't
 produce the better outcomes that we were promised and then it's time
 to rethink maybe there's a different solution that we need to explore.

 Derek: \[19:41\] I'm curious about one of your current projects, the
 collaboration with the Carnegie Mellon University. Can you tell us
 about the Big Data Project and what you hope to learn from it?

 George: \[19:49\] One of the projects we are involved with now
 together with Karen Rossi of Carnegie Mellon and a couple of her peers
 from CMU as well is we are really looking at how do the structures,
 the technological structures that we have, influence our ability to
 learn or to generate knowledge?

 \[20:04\] We're looking at three specific types of spaces, one is
 Wikipedia which the way to collaborate and interact and create
 knowledge in there is fairly distinct. It was innovative 10 years ago
 and it still is. It's become a little more hardened in terms of whose
 editor and who has access so how does knowledge get generated there?

 \[20:23\] The second element is that of Stack Overflow where we're
 seeing individuals who contribute in a Q&A type of site in terms of
 getting their challenging questions answered around programming or
 technology or other needs that they might have.

 \[20:38\] The third relates to MOOCs which is something I've been
 fairly involved with over the last few years and as a result of that
 interest we're trying to see if you're in a MOOC or if you're on Stack
 Overflow or if you're contributing to Wikipedia, how are we generating
 that knowledge? What is the editor model of Wikipedia?

 \[20:57\] How does that influence knowledge generation versus let's
 say the free or flowing anybody can answer a question that you might
 ask and answer a question. On a Stack Overflow type of setting or with
 MOOCs where you have a more traditional, there is still a faculty
 expert, but not the exclusive expert meaning that in a MOOC anyone can
 come in and be an expert though we still heavily defer that role.

 \[21:19\] But really trying to get a better understanding of when
 these environments with these multiple kinds of interaction
 opportunities, how can we learn from different knowledge needs that we
 have as a society and bring that to bear within our classroom?

 \[21:33\] Maybe there are certain kinds of knowledge activities that
 are better suited for open ended collaborative discussions and there's
 others that are better suited because I'm certainly still a fan of a
 lecturer so I'm, when's a lecture appropriate, when's open group work
 appropriate, when's self-work appropriate?

 Derek: \[21:50\] With the Wikipedia model, what might that look like
 in a university setting as knowledge production or learning?

 George: \[21:57\] I think probably the easiest approach would be the
 generation of content and given how expensive textbooks are right now
 just a simple example.

 \[22:06\] I don't see any reason why a group of graduate students
 together with let's say a psychology Prof couldn't generate the
 introductory text book as a Wikipedia project, so the knowledge there
 is that Wikipedia overwrites individual identity, meaning it's really
 a collaborative project so a Wikipedia page doesn't have a voice per
 se.

 \[22:28\] There's a protocols and the editorship and so on around it
 at the top page on Wikipedia entry is where a lot of that mess is but
 the page itself is not tied to an identity.

 \[22:40\] This is an opportunity for learners to have a reasonably
 authentic learning experience writing a text book as a graduate
 student or contributing to writing it and then making that available
 to students who are at a first year level of education. I think that's
 just a simple example of what Wikipedia could help.

 \[22:56\] When you engaged in that, there's a few simple rules
 Wikipedia such as there are certain resources quality criteria that
 need to be met. So it's not that you can just say any random stuff. So
 if you're full of nonsense, then there needs to be some standards for
 what is acceptable and what's not acceptable.

 \[23:12\] There's also the idea of shared governance that occurs
 within a Wikipedia entry. These are practices that students engage in
 if somebody calls into question the validity of an assumption or
 related difficulties that arise with those assumptions such as and
 Wikipedia periodically does lockdown talk pages during periods of high
 controversy in order to let the heat of the emotions of the pass.

 \[23:36\] Those are the kinds of skills I think from a university and
 collegial knowledge creation, understanding shared governance and
 shared processes and management, but still at the end of the day
 recognizing that we have nothing if we're not willing to concede and
 collaborate to produce a better outcome.

 \[23:52\] If all we want to do is stick with our own perspectives and
 our viewpoints, we don't end up creating anything new, and so those
 are I think terrific experiences for students to go through.

 Derek: \[24:01\] I think one of the reasons I ask about Wikipedia is
 this authorship piece. Where I think in academia, we place a high
 value on authorship and voice and when that gets disguised right
 through the collaborative writing, I found instructors, faculty often
 push back against that.

 George: \[24:22\] That's why as we were sort of talking about it
 earlier, it's really about more choices rather than having to make a
 decision between one and the other. It's about having more options
 available so that in context A we could do this. In context B we could
 do that.

 \[24:37\] For example as a faculty member if I want to take a group of
 my psychology or computer science students, graduate level students,
 through a course that has some interesting practical application,
 maybe get them to write the introductory web page for our first year
 students. Save the students a few hundred dollars, have an interesting
 learning experience.

 \[24:55\] Then if I want to work on building my digital identity.
 Let's say I'm a new faculty member, I'm pursuing tenure and I have to
 address not only the traditional publication and grad criteria, I also
 have to be teaching criteria that are increasingly common in the
 university setting as part of tenure.

 \[25:15\] I have to start to find a way to have my work make an
 impact. In that case I might say I'd like the identity value of a
 blog, a Twitter ID, maybe Instagram. I'd like the identity impact of
 personal authorship but that is that context.

 \[25:31\] The context always drives the approach. In my view at least,
 the entire education experience, the entire learning process is really
 just a massive if/then statement, and we forget that sometimes, that
 it's always contextual.

 \[25:43\] There are settings where Wiki is a great idea and other
 settings where it's a terrible idea. There's times when academic needs
 her own voice and there's times where she doesn't and there's really
 no one answer that's right all the time but there's almost always an
 answer that's more correct in one setting than it'll be in another
 setting.

 \[26:00\] Getting that mindset which my interests have been heavily
 around complexity theory and complexity science is lately, and by
 lately I mean the last 12 years, because it addresses the fact that we
 can't govern and practice education effectively through traditional
 rule based approaches. It's much more about taking an eco-system
 rather than an engineer model.

 Derek: \[26:22\] We have a standard question we ask all our guests on
 the podcast. What's your favorite analog educational technology?

 George: \[26:31\] I love the legal pad and paper and a pen. That's
 where I do the bulk of my sketching and I still do. It's a way to
 connect and interact with ideas in very easy way, something about the
 tactile experience.

 \[26:46\] Research recently that emphasizes the value of note taking
 with a pen and paper versus note taking through a keyboard has better

 and you taking this time to share a little bit of your experience and
 expertise with us.

 George: \[27:07\] Thanks, Derek.
