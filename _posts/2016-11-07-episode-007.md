Episode 7: Lynn Ramey

 [00:00] [music]

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:07] Welcome to "Leading Lines," a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, director of the
Vanderbilt's Center for Teaching. In this podcast we explore creative,
intentional, and effective uses of technology to enhance student
learning, uses that point the way to the future of educational
technology in college and university settings.

[00:24] In this episode, we feature an interview with Lynn Ramey,
Associate Professor of French here at Vanderbilt. She is the author of
multiple books and essays including most recently, "Black Legacies: Race
and the European Middle Ages."

[00:36] Lynn is currently engaged in several ambitious digital
projects exploring the use of video games in 3D environments as a means
to explore how societies and cultures have interacted in the past. She
recently sat down with my colleague Ole Molvig, who's exploring similar
issues in a virtual reality lab class.

[00:53] Ole is an assistant professor in the History of Science and
Technology and a member of Vanderbilt's Institute for Digital Learning.

[01:00] The two discussed the challenges in employing complex digital
tools in the humanities. These tools promise for teaching research and
outreach, as well as Lynn's path and experiences in the digital
humanities.

[01:12] [music]

**Ole Molvig**:  [01:16] Hello. On behalf of the Leading Lines
podcast, I'm Ole Molvig. Today, I'm joined by my friend and colleague,
Lynn Ramey, Professor of Medieval French Literature. Welcome, Lynn.

**Lynn Ramey**:  [01:24] Hi.

**Ole**:  [01:25] Before I give you the professional introduction,
could you describe for our listeners one of the current projects that
you're really excited about?

**Lynn**:  [01:31] Sure. Right now, I'm working on a project with a
colleague at the University of Sydney and also with some students. What
we're doing is modeling the movement of people, objects, and text,
through the medieval Mediterranean, particularly through Cyprus.

[01:47] The reason we're doing that, and when I say we're modeling it,
we're modeling it using a game engine, the Unity game engine, because
people know that there was a lot of transmission and cultural contact
from East to West that took place during this period.

[02:01] The period we're looking at is right around 1000 to 1200.
While people know this happened, it's very hard to prove exactly how
something got from, say, Syria, some idea, some person, some object got
from Syria to Spain or France.

[02:17] What we're doing is allowing this environment to let people
make choices about different ways that things can be transmitted and see
how these different factors might have taken place.

**Ole**:  [02:32] That sounds absolutely fascinating. We're going to
get a chance to talk a bit more about some of the programs you talked
about, Unity and others, and some of the storytelling choices they can
give you.

[02:41] First is, I want to talk a bit about your bio here, the back
of the bio page on your website is absolutely charming. It begins with
an unexpected personal narrative, how you got to the position you are
now. Would you mind sharing a bit of your background and personal bio?
How you got to where you are now?

**Lynn**:  [02:54] Sure. I went off to undergraduate as engineer and
when I got there I really...It's not that I didn't like math and
science. I did. I just didn't like the environment. I think it was
pretty much a typical woman in STEM story from back in the '80s where it
was a very closed environment and it wasn't very welcoming.

[03:22] What I did love was taking French, which surprised me somewhat
because I hadn't particularly liked it in high school. I picked it up
again and started taking it. They had a study abroad program for
engineers and that was the only study abroad program that Penn offered
at that time for engineers.

[03:37] I really wanted to just get away and do it and so I did. That
started this love for French and also for math and science. I decided
that the direction I want to go with my career was really more math and
science.

[03:50] [laughter]

**Lynn**:  [03:52] More with French, but I did stick with the math and
science for a while. That's how I got to the French part. I just started
asking questions about how societies interact and how they...Basically,
that was from going to the Peace Corps and seeing some really
interesting interactions that I could have seen back home, now that I
think about it, but I really didn't.

[04:20] Coming from the South, I could have seen all of these same
racial political issues that I saw in Fiji and the Peace Corps, but I
really didn't. It opened my eyes to a lot. When I eventually did go to
graduate school in French, I decided to work on cultural interactions.
That's what I've been working on and that's what almost all my projects
are about.

**Ole**:  [04:40] I noticed you've been publishing on your experiences
between games in a more standard format. That's one way to get the
information out there but I am just curious, how do you categorize the
Cyprus project?

[04:51] Is that a research project? Is it a teaching project? Is it a
public outreach project or in which way does those categories fall apart
when we're talking about the project [inaudible] ?

**Lynn**:  [04:59] Yeah, I think they really do fall apart, as you
said. When we're thinking about the Cyprus project in particular,
there's a ton of research that goes into it, but that can be true for
teaching too, that part. What visualization of anything helps you do is
think up new ways of seeing the same old material that we've looked at
before, and hopefully, lead to new research insights.

[05:24] I think it fits that model of digital humanities where you're
visualizing things and then something comes out of that visualization.
We haven't done it yet so I can't say what's going to come out but I'm
suspecting that what we'll see are some interesting interactions between
different cultures as we track these texts.

[05:44] As for public scholarship, that is a goal of that particular
project. It's a part of a bigger global Middle Ages project that's meant
to outreach, to let people know that there was a lot more interaction
between societies during the middle ages than we imagined.

**Ole**:  [06:02] Do you have some examples from that project or
others that you think really capture how the digital environment is
really able to let the end user experience that mode of contact or those
obvious situation might be better than a more traditional form of
academic writing?

**Lynn**:  [06:19] Yes, there's a project on the global middle age,
it's globalmiddleages.org, and there's one project in particular that
also...maybe I'm particularly drawn to it because it also uses the Unity
3D game engine and it's making a model of tolerance and interaction that
happened in Plasencia, Spain.

[06:42] Roger Martinez has finished that project and it's up. You can
play through it as long as the technology keeps up with it. For that
one, it really does allow you to visualize the spaces that people were
living in. You're particularly looking at a Jewish quarter in Plasencia.
Plasencia is not a very large city.

[07:04] When you realize that everyone was living together and using
the same merchants, the same...really every aspect of village life, you
start to see what it meant to live together in the middle ages for
Christians, Jews, and Muslims.

[07:22] That's one of the ways that we do that. I'm trying to think if
there's some other really good examples.There's a textual project on
there that's very, very nicely done using Scalar which is...It's a
publishing format but it allows you to put in all sorts of video and
whatnot.

[07:46] More than experiencing the world or the environment, it lets
you see the manuscripts that it's talking about right next to the text
and then easily link off into videos, if there are any, or a scholarly
article. It just brings all of the materials together so that you're
not...

[08:06] You're thinking about one concept at the same time. You can
get back and forth pretty easily. Those are two different ways of doing
it.

**Ole**:  [08:16] I first got aware of your digital work through a
project that you were applying for some funds for here, Vanderbilt for
The Voyages of St. Brendan?

[08:26] Could you tell us a bit about the making of that, the
description of what you've done, how you made it, what it involved, who
it involved. As good as possible, what was the goal, what did you do,
and how did you do it.

**Lynn**:  [08:37] Sure. For that project, which is still ongoing but
finishing up hopefully this year, that project is about, again, using a
game engine to enter a medieval environment. In this case, I picked
Anglo‑Norman Britain.

[08:57] The idea is that people who would enter this world, St.
Brendan's world, would be able to experience the culture and the
language as if they were there or as close as we can get to that, to get
that sense of almost being there, which is something that you can't
really have. I like to think of it like a study abroad in the middle
ages because we can't do that.

[09:23] What we can do is recreate the environment and then run to it.
I really think that eventually, we'll get to this point with
[inaudible] that you're doing really. That thing that it will actually
feel like you're there and that that will bring enumerable insights into
what culture was like back then but also just help people be interested
in something that was so far away.

**Ole**:  [09:50] For those of us who don't have a PhD in the Medieval
French Literature, tell us about St. Brendan and who he was, where, and
what the story involves.

**Lynn**:  [09:57] Weirdly, he has no connection with Medieval France
in a weird way but what he did do...The connection with Medieval French
is that he was the subject of the very first Anglo‑Norman text that we
have or what we think is the first, so very early 1000, and it was
probably composed around 800.

[10:20] But Brendan himself was much earlier than that. He was an
Irish monk, and he became a saint before they had any canonization
process. He was a popular saint.

[10:32] He's known for travel. He's a great figure, because not only
is there the story about him that was hugely popular in the middle ages
and was translated into all different medieval languages, not to mention
Latin, but he traveled, according to the story, around looking for
earthly paradise.

[10:52] He went from island to island, and on each island, there is an
adventure, which works nicely for my video game because then at each
stop, there is a goal for user.

[11:04] He traveled around these islands and eventually realized...He
did get to paradise, but he wasn't allowed to enter. But it was one of
those spiritual awakenings that allowed him to come back and be the app
that he was meant to be.

[11:19] The story of St. Brendan continued to live in Europe for many,
many hundreds of years. They really started to believe that he had found
the New World. That legacy is what brought me to him originally because
we were looking at medieval travel, medieval travel to the New World in
particular.

[11:42] Someone even reconstructed Brendan's leather boat to see if he
can make it from Ireland to Nova Scotia, and he did. It would have been
conceivably possible that he did find the New World.

[11:55] We don't have any reason to think he did except in the story,
there are different landmarks that are mentioned like the Crystal Island
that people imagine...they might have been talking about glaciers. If
you really want to, you can make an analogy for each island until he
gets to paradise or the New World.

[12:11] It's just one of those stories that people know about,
especially if you have interest in saints or travel. These things may
bring back this story of St. Brendan.

**Ole**:  [12:28] One of the features of this that I have ever saw
clearly is the language that's used in the game. Although, not mistaken
the old French that is no longer spoken version of...dead language in
essence. This is a way of re‑enacting parts of that.

[12:44] How does that work in terms of...how do you re‑enact a dead
language?

**Lynn**:  [12:46] [laughs] Yes. That's actually really funny. One
of my graduates is really interested in that particular aspect of it.
He's an actor as well. He enjoys not only writing out a conceivable
script for the game, but also reading it in the proper pronunciation and
intonation and all of that.

[13:06] Language is the main goal of that because what we had found
was, and by we, I mean teachers of medieval French. We are a small
group, but we're serious. What we have found is it's sometimes hard to
get students interested in learning medieval French.

[13:23] They're fine with modern French, but part of it is unlike
[inaudible] , which seems to be read aloud a lot in English classes,
medieval French is not. Part of the problem is people don't know how
to...they're not teaching how to pronounce it.

[13:39] One of the goals of this game is to teach proper pronunciation
of old Anglo‑Norman French so that particular professors and people who
are teaching the works can read them correctly and pass that knowledge
along to students who can also get it from the game.

**Ole**:  [13:58] You described this ultimately as an immersion
experience of 1,000 years or a study abroad to another time, another
place. How do you decide which elements are most authentic to represent?
What is that historical research that goes into trying to represent as
best as possible a re‑enacting of the time that we don't have
[inaudible] access to?

**Lynn**:  [14:20] That's a really good question. There's some amount
of luck involved in our choice. Let me calculate this. It's at least 300
years before the first oral story, and the first oral story was another
2 or 300 years before the written story. He's so far removed from the
written story.

[14:48] What we imagine is that, as people were hearing the written
story, they did not imagine sixth‑century Ireland. What they imagined
was what was around them.

[14:56] We capitalize on that by using generic medieval things that we
can find from the Unity Asset Store. That's how we do the environment.
It's a fantasy environment, as we think probably people at the time
would have imagined it, not as it literally was now.

[15:21] If you wanted to do a reconstruction of a sixth‑century
Ireland or something like that, I would think you'd have to go to
archaeological records.

[15:33] We can still make a 3D model of the leather boat. That's
pretty easy because it exists. But for things as you say that don't
exist, we have to go with the literary imagination on what's described.
And a lot of times, not too much is described.

[15:48] We're doing a lot of textual analysis, but I would say less
historical analysis in this particular one. The next project that I'm
doing is going to be the opposite, more historical, more object‑based,
and it's going to be more of a challenge to get the right assets into
the game.

**Ole**:  [16:07] You've mentioned assets and new in the 3D a number
of times. I know that's one of the primary programs that you use. Can
you describe a bit about the tools that you use, the pain points,
learning curves?

[16:17] How do you get the expertise when you run into issues, if you
run into issues? Tell us about the whole workflow in a more technical
side, and feel free to get as technical as you like.

**Lynn**:  [16:26] The game engine itself, basically, just presents
you with a blank screen and then you fill it with the things and the
scene that you want to make. For us, making the landscape, making the
scene is fairly easy.

[16:41] I taught working with my graduate students and undergraduate
students. They can pick this up quickly so that's not really a technical
hoop to jump through.

**Ole**:  [16:51] By quickly, do you mean a couple of weeks, or you
mean a semester, longer?

**Lynn**:  [16:55] Definitely, less than a couple of weeks. There are
a lot of tutorials online for Unity, and you run through one or two of
those that might be even just an hour, and you're ready to try.

[17:07] What I usually find is that people who are comfortable with
technology don't have an issue with this. By comfortable with
technology, I mean, basic things about the computer but they also might
have worked with Photoshop before. That's a big plus. It's similar to
that.

[17:24] If they've ever worked with a 3D modeling program, that's a
huge plus, but I haven't found a lot of students who've done that. We
also...not this particular time, right now, I'm working with students
who are just working on the programming of the game and improving the
look of it, but they're not making their own assets at this point.

[17:45] But I have had students do their own assets in the past. We
use Blender for that. And students, again, if they're comfortable with
Photoshop and willing to try, you're taking 2D drawing to 3D, and it's
not as bad as it sounds. I would say the learning curve on Blender is
much higher than the learning curve on Unity itself, which is a little
odd maybe but it is true.

[18:12] Part of it I think may be the artistic component, but even so
there's just a lot of different buttons and things that you need to
know. The thing with the 3D‑modeling programs, and there are several of
the different ones that you could try, but we just use Blender because
it's free.

[18:31] The thing with that is they don't necessarily label all the
buttons, so it's something that you learn and you get to know as you
work with the program. Learning curve on that I would think that if you
were a student of graphic design, you would spend a whole semester as a
serious course just learning to make reasonable objects in Blender.
That's more complicated.

[18:58] However, I've had students who just loved it and did it on
their own, so that's part of the thing where you just don't know.

**Ole**:  [19:05] Unity and then Blender, both of which are free, at
least, we have free versions of those. I'm also teaching a course at the
moment where we're using Unity, Blender, and some of these other types
of programs.

[19:14] I'm finding surprisingly that the pain point I'm experiencing
is not computer technical knowledge or even some of the scripting
knowledge that's needed for interactions with the environment. I agree
entirely into making environment is surprisingly easy to make impressive
environments relatively quickly.

[19:33] However interacting with them and scripting that stuff, that
seems to be one of the pain points that I'm encountering but even more
so is the artistry.

[19:38] The students are both less eager and less familiar with some
of the more artistic creation and are more willing to learn the
scripting possibilities like how do you interact with the environment.
Has that been relatively similar to your experience?

**Lynn**:  [19:52] Yes, yes, yes. Absolutely. Last summer, I hired a
couple people outside of Vanderbilt, a couple of students, one was an
art student, one was just really interested in art. They were able and
more willing to branch out and make pretty things.

**Ole**:  [20:10] Tell me a bit about the scale of how you do this.
Roughly how many students do you have working on a given game or given
scene at a given time, and who are they?

**Lynn**:  [20:20] My experience even so is fairly limited, but I will
tell you what I'm doing right now and what I did also a year‑and‑a‑half
ago during the summer. We had six students working on different aspects
of the game. At that time we tried Dropbox. That was not very good. We
did it, but it was not adequate.

[20:38] This time I again have six students, and we're using SVN. I'm
checking in with them today, but it seems to be going well. We'll see
how that progresses. This works really well for Brendan because each
student gets a different island.

[20:58] They can really feel like they own that. They think about it.
They read the text very carefully. They interpret it because a lot of
things aren't there.

[21:06] They use their creativity, imagination, whatever, to make the
island and make a language‑learning module that goes with that
particular spot. We get together in a group. We talk about how we want
to set it up, what are we trying to accomplish, then I try to give the
students as much freedom to do what they want with it as I can.

**Ole**:  [21:27] Are these graduate, undergraduate, or a mixture?

**Lynn**:  [21:29] They are a mixture, but in this particular case I
have five undergraduates and one graduate.

**Ole**:  [21:35] I wanted to shift slightly to talk a bit about
pedagogy. It seems like this Brendan example is a really good one, of
course I see pedagogy in playing the game. You're making a learning
experience to immerse yourself in this other period but also a pedagogy
in creating the game. I was curious how you see the different goals in
those two kind of environments in terms of where learning happens.

**Lynn**:  [21:55] That's the thing I notice most about this whole
process is that the people who learn the most from it are the people who
make it. You learn an incredible amount about the text, about the world,
about the culture, about the history just by trying to visualize it and
put it down in a way that hasn't been done.

[22:15] I would think it would be much like a film director or a film
creator. You do a different level of historical analysis. They learn a
huge amount as do I just thinking about, "Well, what did that mean?" or
"How could that have looked if Brendan said mass on a whale? What would
that look like? How would that fool people into thinking it was really
an island?"

[22:40] There are some of those visual questions that you ask, and I
think people learn a lot from that. Also just as we know as teachers,
when you try to teach something, you learn it best.

[22:51] As students are trying to put together a way to learn a
certain aspect of the language, they have to really think about it. "OK,
what is that aspect of the language? How do I teach that? How is it
different from other things?" They get some good experience.

**Ole**:  [23:05] I've been finding somewhat similar...It feels like
the day‑to‑day learning is in the technical components of how do you
learn Unity, how do you learn some of those other computer technologies,
but it's pretty clear that they are motivating them to do a really
thorough historical research to get the details right.

[23:22] They're diving in at a level of enthusiasm that I don't
necessarily see for a standard paper or research paper in some ways
always. At least some students are doing so somewhat differently.

[23:31] I find that pretty exciting that there's a reinforcement
between they're learning the technical material to better present the
humanistic material, but they're learning the humanistic material better
by really trying to maximize its technical potential. I find it really
exciting.

**Lynn**:  [23:45] Me, too.

**Ole**:  [23:46] You mentioned cinema. That's the next question I
wanted to get to you is, why gaming? It seems like the idea of the
cinema as recreating past environments has been with us for quite some
time. What is it particularly about gaming that gives in your mind a
different or a better immersive experience?

**Lynn**:  [24:05] Cinema can be immersive. Certainly as you're
sitting in a theater you might lose yourself. I think that's a common
sense that people get, that they're part of the movie, but you have no
agency. You can't interact with what's going on. For me, that's a key
part of making these games.

[24:23] It can't just be a 3D environment where people explore,
although that is interesting. You have to be able to interact with the
environment, and change things, and change the outcome. That's what
really makes it a game and not just an immersive environment.

**Ole**:  [24:39] The story now become pretty used to my students,
primarily when we learn outside of the classroom about history, I would
say cinema's probably the main method of which they feel they've
experienced the past moments as opposed to textual or otherwise, I'm
assuming that someone's [inaudible] for the literature as well.

[24:57] Those that are paying attention to gaming industry have
continually expanded past cinema. More dollars are in the gaming
industry today than in Hollywood. How would you imagine the change of
how students experience outside a non‑academic history coming in
primarily from games as opposed to from cinema changing how they view
their take on history or literature?

**Lynn**:  [25:24] That's interesting.

**Ole**:  [25:24] Have you noticed effects along those lines yet or...

**Lynn**:  [25:27] One of the things I'm really surprised with is how
few of my students are really into games, which I thought every young
person was into games. Yes. No, at least at this point not everyone is
into games, but when they are they realize that there's a difference
between the game that they're playing and the so‑called real middle
ages, say.

[25:54] I think with movies there's more of an attempt to blur that
line. Not always, there are certainly some that are meant to be funny
and comedies and all of that. With video games students seem more aware
that it's not how it really was. On the other hand, that's where I think
the [inaudible] for academics to jump in because it really isn't.

[26:14] These games that are all about killing orcs and body wenches
and this kind of thing, we could do a better job I think than the video
game industry does. I'm not sure that we could do a better job than the
movie industry. I'm very impressed with most of what the movie industry
does. I know there's niggling little things that bother people about,
"This is a historical...or whatnot."

[26:35] The video game industry with a few exceptions and one of them
is the Assassin's Creed series, which I think is good, but most of the
time it's not even an attempt to really make it like the Middle Ages.

**Ole**:  [26:49] One of the things I'm interested in, a small number,
but a number of games are increasingly promoting the historical fidelity
of some degree as one of the selling points of the game. I imagine that
will potentially only increase. This is to me an area where humanists or
non‑gaming professionals might have a way of shaping some of the future
of how these games are designed.

**Lynn**:  [27:11] I hope so.

**Ole**:  [27:11] Do you have any advice for other scholars or
humanists to get involved? What's the level of expertise required? You
mentioned you used to be a software engineer at some point. Is that a
requirement to be able to get a job into these types of teaching
environments?

**Lynn**:  [27:22] No, absolutely not. I did learn a lot, C++, C,
Pascal, a lot of programming languages back in the day, but I don't
necessarily remember how to do that because I haven't used it, it's just
like any other language you don't use. I don't remember it. I'd have to
look it up. Seriously, the only advantage that I would have is that I'm
not afraid of the technology.

[27:48] I think a lot of people are. It's really not that daunting. If
you go through, say, the tutorials. I have some colleagues who just set
their students loose on it. They don't even try to learn the technology.
I think that's fine. Just say, "OK, students. I want to see what you can
do to make an environment using this program," and see what they manage
to do in groups.

[28:12] I probably wouldn't make a student do that individually. At
least for this colleague it worked out great. They have some amazing 3D
immersive environments of medieval Africa. I think really you just have
to be willing to say, "This is something that I don't fully master."
Even if you worked in a game company, you would not fully master every
aspect of the game.

[28:36] This is where I think it's hard for humanists. You really have
to see yourself more as a project director and not as a content master
because I think we have complete control over our monographs, and
articles, and things like that. We don't know how sometimes to just let
a little bit or a lot go, and that's what you have to do with this.

**Ole**:  [28:58] A complete pivot here. We hear a lot about the
crisis of the humanities. Do you feel the humanities needs saving? If
so, is [inaudible] inclusion one of the solutions?

**Lynn**:  [29:11] I don't think humanities in itself needs saving in
the sense that it's still teaching and helping us think about the
timeless questions that humanity has had forever and that we need to
continue to think about. It's what makes us different from animals. I
really don't think that the humanities are in crisis, but I think
respect for the humanities might be a little bit down.

[29:35] Generally, the thinking is that people will have more respect
for the humanities if it's connected with STEM. I don't know if that's
true. It doesn't work for me because I think that there are all sorts of
different humanists out there and that some of the most exciting work is
digital and some of it is not. We really can't make it all go one way or
another because we would lose so much.

[30:00] I do think and it has been shown from what I can tell there
are many more grant opportunities for digital work. I think that's
basically a societal thought that STEM is more important than
humanities. It's a way to catch onto that, but I'm not sure that it's
giving us more than regular, traditional scholarship was giving us
already. It's just a different thing.

**Ole**:  [30:26] I liked how you phrased, "You don't need a level of
expertise of any computer program or not to be afraid to get your hands
dirty and learn these things."

[30:33] You mentioned way back in the beginning when you were talking
about yourself as a young college student, the traditional story of a
woman in STEM. Tell me about being a woman in digital humanities.

**Lynn**:  [30:46] Yeah...

[30:47] [laughter]

**Ole**:  [30:48] Is the story different?

**Lynn**:  [30:50] Not really.

[30:50] [laughter]

**Lynn**:  [30:52] No, not really. I don't know. I think I see some of
the same patterns. The good thing about digital humanities is that I
think there's a focus on collaboration that wasn't necessarily there
back in engineering days. I mean there was, but there was also
exclusion. When we would do group projects, the guys didn't really want
me to be on their team.

[31:20] It sounds like middle school or something but it was true. I
had trouble connecting with them because we had different interests and
it was strange. Now, I think there's more of a collaborative experience.
You can't help but notice that so many more women are in humanities, at
least in French and the languages than there are men.

[31:44] Yet we're still turning out more digital humanists who were
men or even if it were equal, that wouldn't be quite right. I don't
know. I think there is an attempt. There's certainly an attempt to
recognize this. There's plenty of different movements that are saying,
"OK, we need to make sure that we don't replicate these women,
minorities," that feeling of exclusion.

[32:07] I think it did reproduce itself and now maybe we're a lot
faster at it, having lived through it before, maybe we're a lot faster
at breaking it down, so I think that's a plus.

**Ole**:  [32:20] That's one of the anxieties that I had in adding the
digital component to my classes. I do teach science and technology. I
was already concerned that my classes were skewed male in terms of the
undergraduate population, and how much effort did I want to put into
something that would perhaps exacerbate that particular issue, this
standard stereotype of who'd be interested in doing the virtual reality
laboratory.

[32:42] I found that my students tend to about 50 percent female and
about 50 percent male and my very limited case study. When you teach
undergraduates, are you finding the gender expectations to match what
you'd expect or to be kind of surprising?

**Lynn**:  [32:56] Yeah, I know what you're talking about, and I had
the same thought but I was reading different studies on gaming and
learning and gaming, and it seems that at least lately anyway, women are
playing more games than men, but I think that there are different kinds
of games.

[33:10] These first person shooters, I have had one or two women who
have enjoyed doing them in the past and jumped right in, but usually it
is guys that have a lot of experience with Halo or whatever. With Unity
3D, that's the environment that you're building in the sense that you're
using an avatar that's giving you a first person perspective usually.
Sometimes third person but often first person.

[33:38] What does that mean? I think for me, it's not that the women
don't want to do it, because they do, every bit as much as the men, but
they may not have had as much experience playing these sorts of games.
Some of them have so I would just say, I focus not based on gender, but
just for my own thoughts about how we should be moving forward with
gaming in education.

[34:06] I try to remove the shooter aspect of it to make it less about
the masculine warfare games that may have been particularly interesting
to certain men and some women, and make it more about the adventure
games, King's Quest games, those types of games that I know both genders
enjoy, usually.

[34:33] There's no way to say. Even if you were to take away the
male‑female divide, if there is such a thing in this, you still run into
the technophobic or the people who just don't like games or were raised
believing that they're a waste of time, or that they...There's still a
lot of parents that won't let their kids have a game console, or watch
TV, so you do deal with that.

**Ole**:  [34:58] We have a standard question here in this podcast
that we ask all of our guests the final question which is, what is your
favorite analogue educational technology?

**Lynn**:  [35:06] Oh, gosh, OK. Analogue, let's see. I think that
students enjoy games even if they're not digital. I do play games with
my students and there are quite a few that are medieval. Carcassonne is
one, but these are board games that you can play, and then there's a
whole...I don't know if you've worked with it at all, but I think it's
called like Representing The Past. That's a cool thing.

**Ole**:  [35:31] Have you run any of those medievals?

**Lynn**:  [35:32] No, I mean I've looked into it, and I've thought
about it, and I've watched other people do it. I belong to the mailing
list but I haven't tried it yet, but I think it's a great idea.

**Ole**:  [35:42] I'm in the same boat and I work in [inaudible] .
Let me try to figure out if I can figure out a nice way to incorporate
this in some of the classroom teaching. Well then, thank you so much for
sharing your time.

[35:51] [music]

**Lynn**:  [35:51] Sure.

**Ole**:  [35:51] Appreciate it.

**Lynn**:  [35:52] Yeah, that helps.

**Derek**:  [35:53] That was Lynn Ramey, Associate Professor of
French, here at Vanderbilt University. Thanks to Ole Molvig for that
interview. I was struck by Lynn's comment that the people who learned
the most from these historical games are the people who make them.

[36:06] Here at the Center for Teaching, we've been exploring the idea
of students as producers. Engaging students not long as consumers of
information, but producers of knowledge. We've seen time and again how
having students apply what they're learning to create something,
particularly something intended for an authentic audience, motivates
them toward deeper learning.

[36:24] I'll put a link in the show notes to a resource or two from
our student's producer's work. I was also struck by Lynn's mentioned of
the analogue game, Carcassonne, it's a favorite of mine. That makes two
episodes in which board games have come up. Perhaps we'll do a whole
episode someday on teaching and board games.

[36:39] If that sounds interesting, let us know. You can reach us
through our website leadinglinespod.com and on Twitter, where our handle
is @leadinglinespod.

[36:48] Leading Lines is produced by the Center for Teaching, the
Vanderbilt Institute for Digital Learning, the office of Scholarly
Communications, and the Associate Provost for Digital Learning. Look for
new episodes the first and third Monday of each month. I'm your host,
Derek Bruff. Thanks for listening.
