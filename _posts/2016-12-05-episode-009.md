In this episode, we feature an interview with mathematician Paul Dehaye.  Dehaye is known as the instructor of a 2014 massive open online course (MOOC) about massive open online courses that was mysteriously cancelled one week in.  Dehaye is interviewed by John Sloop, Vanderbiltâ€™s Associate Provost for Digital Learning, who met Dehaye at an Open edX conference last summer.  Dehaye shares his perspective on that 2014 incident, and he comments on the role of for-profit companies in higher education, the future of online education, and the still untapped potential of MOOCs.
