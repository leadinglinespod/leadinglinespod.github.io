This episode features an interview with Tim Foster, a graduate student in Vanderbilt’s Department of Spanish and Portuguese.  Tim is an active member of the digital humanities community at Vanderbilt, and he has worked at the Center for Teaching, the Center for Second Language Studies, and the Vanderbilt Institute for Digital Learning.  Last fall, Tim was on a panel at Vanderbilt that focused on teaching with Wikipedia, where he shared a class project in which he worked with his students to write for the Portuguese language version of Wikipedia.  Derek Bruff spoke with Tim about this project, as well as a few of Tim’s other experiments in educational technology.
