## Episode 13: Tim Foster

[00:00] [music]

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:06] Welcome to "Leading Lines", a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I'm your host, Derek Bruff, director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching. In this episode, I speak with Tim
Foster, a graduate student here in Vanderbilt's Department of Spanish
and Portuguese.

[00:17] Tim is an active member of the digital humanities community
here and he has worked at the Center for Teaching, the Center for Second
Language Studies, and the Vanderbilt Institute for Digital Learning. Tim
uses technology in his teaching in creative, intentional, and effective
ways. I'm excited to share some of his work here on the podcast.

[00:35] Last fall, Tim was on a panel that my center co‑organized with
Vanderbilt's new Center for Digital Humanities. The panel focused on
teaching with Wikipedia. I was impressed with the class project that Tim
shared in which he worked with his students to write for the Portuguese
language version of Wikipedia. Tim and I sat down to talk last December,
shortly after that panel.

[00:53] [music]

**Derek**:  [00:56] Thanks for talking with me today, Tim. I'm looking
forward to chatting a little bit about your teaching experience and ways
you've used technology.

**Tim Foster**:  [01:04] Absolutely, thanks for having me.

**Derek**:  [01:06] Let's start with a little bit of context. Tell us
who you are and what you do here at Vanderbilt and that kind of thing.

**Tim**:  [01:12] I'm a fifth‑year graduate student in the Department
of Spanish and Portuguese. I'm finishing my dissertation on the job
market now.

[01:19] I have taught for three years in the department. We teach as
instructors of record, the elementary to intermediate language courses.
I taught six semesters of that.

[01:33] I was a course assistant on Maymester trip, walking the Camino
de Santiago or the Way of St. James pilgrimage in Spain. I also taught a
course at the Vanderbilt Program for Talented Youth, at Peabody, which
was a really great teaching experience.

**Derek**:  [01:54] Was that a summer course?

**Tim**:  [01:56] Yeah, summer course, a week‑long course. I taught
about Spanish Conquistadors to fourth and fifth graders.

[02:03] It was a really great experience, honestly one of the hardest
things I've ever done, but something that really helped give me teaching
experience as a graduate student, really substantive teaching
experience, and also helped me rethink my own research agendas in ways I
never expected.

[02:20] Because to present something to third and fourth graders
really forces you to think and make choices about where you're going
with your own research and teaching, [laughs] but it's neither here
nor there.

**Derek**:  [02:34] [laughs] Yeah, that's neat though. You mentioned
your research is in there. Can you tell us a little bit about that?

**Tim**:  [02:40] Yeah, I'm an early modernist, so I study 16th and
17th century Spain, and I'm writing a dissertation about the
representation of music and how it gets framed through the lens of
empire, in the Spanish Empire.

[02:59] It's always an interesting thing, since we're thinking about
digital educational technology. The way that my dissertation works, it
would have been a lot harder 15 years ago, because digitization is at
such a high level that all these texts that I consult, I would have had
to travel to various libraries throughout Spain, and who knows where
else.

[03:26] Now they are all facsimile scans on the National Library of
Spain or other websites. It's incredible, the amount of those old texts
that we have because of digitization efforts. That really enhances our
research.

**Derek**:  [03:49] Well, I want to maybe come back to that in a
minute as we think about how that carries over into your teaching. I
know that you said a lot of your teaching here at Vanderbilt has been in
language courses.

**Tim**:  [04:01] Yes.

**Derek**:  [04:01] Can you tell us a little bit about some of those
courses and some of the experiments in digital pedagogy that you've
tried?

**Tim**:  [04:08] Absolutely. We have the strange distinction in the
foreign languages of what we research and what we teach is in some ways
distinct. We're researching literature, but we teach the language.

[04:21] We're always trying to find ways to bring literature and bring
cultural material into the language classroom to really give a
contextualized and culture‑centered language education. What we do is
we're mostly given the syllabus by our department, but a lot of the
day‑to‑day activities we get to determine.

[04:47] The interesting thing about foreign language pedagogy is that
there's this concept from, I don't know, 30 years ago called
Computer‑Assisted Language Learning, CALL. It's one of those buzzwords
that gets through, and they're like, "Oh, I'm proficient in CALL."

**Derek**:  [05:03] [laughs] .

**Tim**:  [05:03] We had this interesting discussion a few years ago
that computer‑assisted language learning is basically just language
learning now because it's so ubiquitous, and has so transformed the way
that you're able to bring authentic cultural material into the
classroom.

[05:23] Whereas, before the profusion of the Internet, maybe what you
have are some books that you gathered during your travels abroad or even
little pamphlets or brochures or maps.

[05:39] Those things are really the ephemera of any day‑to‑day life,
but that's where language is spoken. Before the Internet, maybe you only
have stuff that you're able to gather personally or the scripted things
that they put in textbooks.

[06:00] Which give a good approximation, sometimes, [laughs] of real
cultural material, but it's no substitute for what we're able to do now
which, for example, if we're talking about clothing, we're wanting to
learn sizes and colors and talking about how to buy clothing in a store.

[06:21] What I'll do is set my students loose on one of the major
department store's websites in Spain, for example, and say, "Buy this,"
and give them a little guidance of...maybe they would write a couple of
sentences about what they want to buy, or just give them some framework
to, or some questions to answer something, and just let them loose on
the authentic material.

[06:49] That's a real advantage that we have as language teachers,
that we have the whole Internet [laughs] of cultural reality available
to us.

**Derek**:  [06:57] You were on a panel here a few weeks ago on
teaching with Wikipedia.

**Tim**:  [07:03] Yes, that's right.

**Derek**:  [07:04] Which is a very different use of online resources.

**Tim**:  [07:09] Absolutely.

**Derek**:  [07:09] Can you say a little bit about what that
experiment was and where it came from, which I though was really
fascinating?

**Tim**:  [07:16] Wikipedia I've always found very useful in my own
language learning and cultural research, because what I said in my
presentation is that Wikipedia is kind of the Goldilocks of resources
where you're looking at material in two different languages.

[07:39] You have three distinct types of dictionaries, to call them
that way. You have the word reference, or your Oxford Spanish‑English
Dictionary, which gives you a couple of definitions of variants from one
term from Spanish to English, for example.

[08:01] Or you have the Oxford English Dictionary, or the Spanish
equivalent which would be the Royal Academy Dictionary which gives you
15 terms, 5 of which are archaic and are only used in my period.
[laughs] It's overkill for students, especially for beginning
students, but neither of them does terms very well, and neither of them
does cultural concepts very well.

[08:29] If you want to look up the United Nations organization, for
example, you're going to find it's going to literally translate United
Nations organization, or it'll give you a definition of what it does,
but that's no help in how do you say United Nations organization in
Spanish, because there's a particular name for it.

[08:51] What I always do in those situations is go to Wikipedia page.
On the left‑hand side, it has all those different languages, the
articles in all the different languages, and change the language and
there you have it. It gives you the name and all the cultural
information.

[09:09] The example of this that I gave in class was that a student
asked me how do you say "Ice Bucket Challenge" in Spanish.

**Derek**:  [09:18] [laughs] .

**Tim**:  [09:18] This was back in, I think, 2014 when that was a big
thing.

**Derek**:  [09:23] There were all these viral videos on Facebook of
people pouring ice on themselves for some good cause I think.

**Tim**:  [09:28] Yeah, for ALS I think. I said, "I don't know." I
could translate "ice" and "bucket" and "challenge," but it would be some
kind of gobbledygook.

[09:41] I did exactly what I'm saying, went to the Wikipedia page and
switched to Spanish. My student asked, "Is that a good translation?" and
I said, [laughs] "That's not a translation."

[09:54] In that moment, it dawned on me that for the student, they had
assumed that all cultural production was in English and that everything
not in English was a translation.

**Derek**:  [10:06] That the Spanish language Wikipedia page for Ice
Bucket Challenge was merely a translation of an English language page
for that topic.

**Tim**:  [10:15] It must have been. Exactly.

**Derek**:  [10:15] But that's not how Wikipedia works, right?

**Tim**:  [10:17] No, exactly. It's all independent content written in
the language. Perhaps, Ice Bucket Challenge is something that originates
in American English, but there are also communities of all language
speakers in the United States that talk about the ice bucket challenge
in their own language.

[10:37] That's a cultural concept born in English, but it also has
original content in other languages. That's not even considering whole
concepts that are born in foreign languages and translated into English.
[laughs]

[10:52] I think that when we have a two‑monolingual approach in our
society, we encourage thought patterns that suggest that all content is
born in English and then translated outwards. I got to thinking about
that understanding of my students. A couple of semesters ago, the spring
of '15, I got to be the coordinator of my own Portuguese course.

[11:24] I was the only teacher of the intensive elementary Portuguese
section that semester, which rarely ever happens and was really such a
great good fortune on my part that I was able to design a syllabus for
that class...not really design a syllabus but design all the principal
activities, the assessments.

**Derek**:  [11:44] You didn't have to link up with other sections of
the same course. You run your own show.

**Tim**:  [11:51] Exactly.

**Derek**:  [11:51] It sounds like a bit of a gift for a grad student
in your program.

**Tim**:  [11:55] It really was. There are other disciplines in which
graduate students get to design their own syllabi, but there are a lot
of disciplines...

**Derek**:  [12:02] It's pretty rare, actually, right?

**Tim**:  [12:03] Yeah.

**Derek**:  [12:03] English and philosophy are the other two that I
know of on our campus.

**Tim**:  [12:09] English and philosophy, right. A lot of graduate
students are TAs, in the sense that they are assisting faculty members.
We're considered TAs, I suppose, although we are the instructors of
record in our classes. We give the grades. It was a great opportunity
for me to implement this activity that I wanted to do.

[12:25] In fact, I didn't even think of it until halfway through the
semester, which is why, like you said, I didn't have to link it up with
somebody else's syllabus. I was able to, on the fly, make this change,
where I substituted the final composition for the Portuguese class ‑‑ it
usually is a one‑and‑a‑half or two‑page essay ‑‑ for a Wikipedia
assignment, where I had each student write a section of a Wikipedia
page.

[12:55] I contemplated at first having them write their own page, but
I thought that would be too laborious and distract from the point of the
exercise, which was to both think about these real‑world applications of
their language and also to think through my particular paths issue of
having students think that English is the only place where content can
be boarded.

[13:22] What we did was, first, we had to look a little bit at what
Wikipedia is. A lot of students had used it before but didn't have a
good idea of how the content was really generated, what are some of the
identity politics, issues behind the production of Wikipedia.

[13:44] There's a very high percentage of the content that's produced
by white young males in English‑speaking context. We couldn't really do
a lot to change those statistics in my particular case because we're
Americans. A lot of my students were white. A lot of my students were
males.

[14:03] Even so, thinking through that is truly important in any
context when you're dealing with Wikipedia.

**Derek**:  [14:12] Especially for Wikipedia. One of the reasons that
academics are a little bit queasy about Wikipedia is that there's no
sense of authorship. You contribute content, and then it's this entry.
Yes, it's possible to find out who put in which sentence and which
phrase, but it doesn't make that very clear or very obvious.

**Tim**:  [14:30] Exactly. It's an [inaudible] to all of the
structures of authority that we have been creating over centuries.

**Derek**:  [14:40] Right, our peoples' authorial voices, our citation
systems. It's just a very different way of doing things. Clearly, with
students who may also think of Wikipedia as somehow authorless, it's
helpful to pull back the curtain a little bit so that they can see
actually how it gets made, how that might show up, and what you see
there.

**Tim**:  [14:59] Absolutely, and how it might influence how they
write because a large portion of thinking through Wikipedia, too, is the
authorial tone...not authorial tone but the neutral tone. It's not an
argument. It's more of a summation of knowledge about any particular
topic.

[15:25] Our first step was looking through what Wikipedia is, and then
we had to decide on an article. I wanted an article in Portuguese
Wikipedia about something that the students could really contribute
knowledge to, but that was not covered well.

[15:40] I looked at a couple of pages, like the American South,
Vanderbilt University, for example. What my students decided that they
wanted to do was the page on Nashville, the city. It was about a
paragraph long, maybe two. Just basic information, no tables, no
graphics, nothing.

**Derek**:  [15:59] I can imagine the English language national page
is probably pages and pages of history and information and culture.

**Tim**:  [16:06] With 50 citations‑plus and different sections on
everything, exactly.

**Derek**:  [16:10] This was an underdeveloped part of the Portuguese
Wikipedia?

**Tim**:  [16:13] Exactly. Probably understandably so, although
Portuguese Wikipedia has large pages on many major American cities. Some
of the biggest cities known to Brazilians are New York and Orlando, for
example. They have huge pages.

[16:27] My students, I had them each decide on a section of the page
that interested them. One did about demographics. One did about sports.
One did about tourism. One did about healthcare, etc. I have 12
different students, so 12 different sections.

[16:53] Actually, I only did it in about five weeks, which was crazy
for everybody. That first week, I had them bring in at least three
citations that they were going to use, a little outline of their
article.

[17:08] Then the next week, I had them write the section. It was, I
think, 450 to 500 words in a word processor. Just deal with the language
part. That was the baseline. That's what they would have been doing with
the other essay. The other essay...

**Derek**:  [17:24] Composing in Portuguese.

**Tim**:  [17:25] Exactly. Which is ultimately, the point of the
class. Typically, a prompt in a beginning language class is something
like, "Write a fake blog post about yourself and your daily routine and
where you go to school and who your friends are."

[17:42] That's interesting. It helps them use the language at the
level that they can really write something that they know, but it's not
robust. It's not making any argument. There's also something we talk
about a lot in language learning that is too me‑centered.

[18:00] A lot of the time when you're talking, doing verbal practice
in the language class, it's all about me. You're saying, "I go to the
store. I eat apples. I like eating..."

**Derek**:  [18:15] I have two aunts and an uncle."

**Tim**:  [18:16] Exactly, which is fine. You need to be able to talk
about yourself, but I think it only furthers this kind of English
centered approach or whatever I'm familiar with is what is important.

[18:28] That's another really big advantage to doing this, not only
having the sources cited, but writing in this more neutral Wikipedia
tones that you get out of the media centered language production.

**Derek**:  [18:44] They can still write about something they know, or
learning to know, as they're mostly new, international. It's a topic of
interest to them, but it's not themselves.

**Tim**:  [18:55] Exactly. I had them do some peer editing on their
little section. Then I did a lot of editing to make sure that their
grammar was as flawless as possible. Then, when they had the finished
language piece, we did some coding basics in class. It took about 30
minutes one day. This class met four days a week, so we had a little bit
of time to do some of the training.

[19:25] I did find that the students struggled a little bit more than
I thought. That goes back to a lot of the discussions around our
"digital natives," but really, we can't assume too much. Coding is a
different thought process, and I think it was a lot to expect of them in
a week and half's time.

**Derek**:  [19:53] I'm going to play my computer science major card
here. I wouldn't call [inaudible] coding, either. You're not
programming it to do things. You're formatting using text markup.

**Tim**:  [20:01] That's a good point.

**Derek**:  [20:02] Again, there's a learning curve there. I don't do
that very often and I know how to use markup languages, right? When I
have to actually code something in HTML, it's usually because something
has broken and I have to go in a fix it just the right way.

[20:17] But, yeah, to think that students would know that or be
familiar with that, that's just not how they typically use technology.

**Tim**:  [20:23] It's true.

**Derek**:  [20:24] It might also circle back to what you said about
who contributes to Wikipedia. If students start to have an understanding
of what it requires technically to contribute, that might help them give
a little more sense of who are the people here to have those skills or
that aptitude?

**Tim**:  [20:40] Or who have been taught that they have that aptitude
or who have the accessibility to the Internet for long enough to develop
that aptitude? Wikipedia does a nice job of providing tutorials.

[20:56] They have a general tutorial that explains Wikipedia and how
to use it, but they have specific ones for students. They have specific
ones for educators of some of the things to keep in mind when you are
bring Wikipedia into the classroom. They have a special set for
particular higher ed professionals, and they have a series of case
studies.

[21:20] It's all done through the Wikimedia Foundation. They have a
series of case studies of how different faculty members have used
Wikipedia in the classroom on a wide variety of subjects for different
purposes.

[21:33] One that really stuck out to me was, I think it was an Art
History class, they had students add images to Wikipedia pages. It
wasn't even writing content, but it was providing some of that image
support. There's a lot of really interesting ways that people are using
Wikipedia.

**Derek**:  [21:55] Your students collaboratively helped to flush out
the Nashville page, right?

**Tim**:  [22:01] Mm‑hmm.

**Derek**:  [22:07] I'm curious. Like you said, you could have had
them write essays and turn that in, but they were writing about a
particular topic for a particular website. You could have also had them
all just write a little guidebook to Nashville in Portuguese that you
put on your own website that they never shared online.

[22:24] What do you see as advantages of going full Wikipedia and
having them go there to do this kind of writing?

**Tim**:  [22:32] I think there's something basic in knowing that what
you produce is going to be out there for people to see that I think
makes you really heighten your own sense of the value of it and heighten
the work you put into it.

[22:49] I was floored by the amount of work that my students did for
this, not only the good writing that they did and the references that
they brought in. I had the 3 references as a baseline, but a lot of them
brought in 10 or more references, which is amazing. They just went above
and beyond.

[23:09] They had to learn the markup. There's a good distinction
between coding and markup. Then, on the day when we put it all together,
those who had finished everything and it was really clean, I asked them
if they wanted to markup the climate tables and the sister cities which
all required a little bit more advanced marking up. They just ran with
it, those who had the aptitude and the time. That was really great.

[23:47] I found that kind of thing, where your assignment is done and
you're sitting there altogether in class with your laptops open, "What
am I going to do? Am I going to surf the Web or am I going to help my
class and contribute to this awesome project that we're doing together?"

**Derek**:  [24:03] And make it even better.

**Tim**:  [24:05] I don't think I would have seen that extra effort
had this been something that just got turned in to me. I think students
want their work to be impactful. Not that a professor reading it is not
a wonderful exercise, but...

**Derek**:  [24:24] Right, but it's not an audience of one and no one
ever sees it again.

**Tim**:  [24:27] That's right. I found that there's a buy in from the
students that I don't think that there would have been otherwise. That
was really the advantage of doing something, going full Wikipedia, as
you said. It was really going full Wikipedia.

[24:42] The students all did have to create their own Wikipedia
account so that they could play in the Sandbox. They have what is called
Sandbox where you can test the markup that you have done and make sure
that it all plays out OK and make sure there's no errors.

[25:02] They all had to sign up for their own accounts on Portuguese
Wikipedia. You have to sign up for different accounts on different
Wikipedias, which was fun.

[25:10] I wanted the students originally to make the edits themselves
on the Wikipedia page and put in their new section, but what I found was
that when I went in and created the skeleton for what our new page was
going to look like.

[25:27] I tried to upload that change and I got a nasty note from a
Portuguese administrator that said, "The Real Page Editing is not the
Sandbox. Don't put titles with empty content in them." It was like 20
seconds after I had made the change.

[25:42] I was going to have the students do it five minutes after that
because we were in the class. I said, "Well, I guess everybody, you can
just send your code to me and I'll upload it altogether.

**Derek**:  [25:55] All at once.

**Tim**:  [25:56] I thought that was really a good lesson, something
that we were all learning together. The students thought it was really
funny because they got to see their professor get scolded by a
Portuguese Wikipedia administrator.

**Derek**:  [26:13] In real time.

**Tim**:  [26:13] In real time, yeah. They were all reading it and
they were like, "Oh, that's a command. They really got you good."

**Derek**:  [26:23] They were using the skills they had learned to
enjoy your scolding.

**Tim**:  [26:28] It was a lot of fun. I was happy to have been the
butt of that, yeah.

**Derek**:  [26:35] This is what I like about these types of projects.
There's this term that's used in different ways in literature. I would
say what you've done is you turned your class from a class into a
learning community, in that the students are all there learning
together, with each other, with you, learning from each other.

[26:51] It's not just this one‑way dump of information in school
development. They are building something together. They're proud of it.

**Tim**:  [27:00] Absolutely we're proud. I think, on that point, the
next time I do this, I will build in more peer review. We did one very
cursory round of peer review on the language side and a half a peer
review round on the coding, the markup. We just didn't have time,
because I didn't think of this until halfway through the semester, but
the next time I'll really start this earlier.

[27:31] Actually, what I want to start with first is doing a
translation. I hate to say this, but doing a translation of something, a
cultural concept on foreign language Wikipedia that just isn't there in
English. There's a ton of random regional food products or whatever,
that just have not analogue or they have no presence at all in English
Wikipedia.

[28:00] I would love to have students take a paragraph or two, a
little article, and translate that and submit a new article in English
as a first step to this. Understanding that not all production on
Wikipedia is a translation. I would have to put a huge asterisk on that.

[28:16] That might be a nice steppingstone because they would be doing
it. The first Wikipedia article that they edit would be in their native
language rather than in a language that they're just learning.

**Derek**:  [28:28] I was just imagining, you mentioned they had to
sign up for accounts in the Portuguese Wikipedia, which is a process
that's all in Portuguese. That alone would be perhaps a little
challenging.

**Tim**:  [28:39] Yes. It takes you three hours to read the terms and
conditions, if anybody reads those.

[28:43] [laughter]

**Derek**:  [28:45] We talked a lot about this one particular
application, which I think is really fascinating and raises some
interesting learning dynamics that we've talked about. Let's take a step
back and think a little bit more broadly and you mentioned next time.
Maybe I'll ask you about it.

[29:03] As you look ahead to your teaching career, are there either
technologies you want to try out or ways of using technology that you
want to make a part of your teaching as you go forward?

**Tim**:  [29:19] That's a really interesting question. As I go
forward, I anticipate teaching both language and literature culture
classes. That changes the way that you incorporate technology. One thing
I always loved to play with is mapping. I've done some at work with
mapping before in a language course.

[29:41] Instead of doing a traditional oral exam presentation, we
developed a little assignment where students would go into Google Earth
and go into street view of a random Latin American city and narrate
their journey. "First I went to this restaurant and ate this. Then I
went to this plaza and saw this monument."

[30:05] It was really fun. I had three students who had recently been
to the Dominican Republic. They weren't particularly strong students,
but they gave the best presentation because they had been there and they
were telling about their actual trip. It was amazing.

[30:23] I thought that was a really powerful use of that technology.

**Derek**:  [30:28] In the target language, right?

**Tim**:  [30:28] In the target language. Exactly. I'd love to build
it more with mapping, not only the language learning side but also
literature. A lot of literature is special. There's a lot of spacial
components.

[30:42] We've done a lot of work with that at the Center for Second
Language Studies where I was a graduate affiliate for three years about
mapping novels and creating a digital map and putting passages that
happened at a particular location on the map. I think it's a really
different way for students to interact with a text.

[31:07] Also, one project that I worked on and really wanted to
implement was, we have this Maymester trip that goes on the pilgrimage,
The Way of St. James in Spain. I had built my own digital map of some of
these...well, I call them folk shrines.

[31:28] As you're walking on the pilgrimage you see people building a
little shrine to a dead pilgrim or building a shrine to the saints, for
example. I photographed those and made a nice little map of it and
that's where it stayed.

[31:43] In talking with the Professor who runs that program, we really
wanted to have the students do something similar, where they would
record a video talking in Spanish about a particular location on the
trail that was meaningful to them.

[31:59] Or taking a video by a monument and describing some of its
features that we had talked about in class, some of the architectural
styles or whatever. Or a location where something important in
literature happened.

[32:11] Taking a video of that, and then uploading that video and
creating a class record of these impactful moments or sites to each
student. But doing it all together, so that we would map out the route
of the pilgrimage and also practice the language, which is always
important even in upper level literature courses.

[32:33] Practicing language is always fundamental. Also, some cultural
and literary knowledge. It would be a nice product that the class would
have.

[32:45] We worked on that project for a little bit but when the
students got to Spain ‑‑ this is the year after I had assisted with the
course ‑‑ when they got there the Internet connectivity was just too
much of a disaster. Each hostel or hotel maybe had WiFi and it maybe
worked but not for long enough for them to get their videos uploaded.

[33:08] We thought about having them do it when they got home but it
just wouldn't have been the same. That was a bummer, but something that
I'm looking to incorporate into classes that I do in the future.

**Derek**:  [33:20] There's something about being in the field and
being able to document and then build that collaborative product
together.

**Tim**:  [33:25] Exactly.

**Derek**:  [33:25] You can have them do it when they get home, but it
would be a different kind of activity there. It might be a more
reflective or synthetic activity, but it might not have the same type of
in the moment capturing of the experience.

[33:40] I'm going to end with one more question. We ask this of all of
our guests. We talk a lot about digital technology on this podcast.
What's one of your favorite analog technologies?

**Tim**:  [33:52] I've been thinking a lot about this question.

[33:55] [laughter]

**Tim**:  [33:55] At the risk of sounding too, I don't know, cheesy or
cute, I want to say the classroom. There is something about being in the
classroom where you have the social interactions before and after class
and during class. [laughs] You have the ability to pair off, to do
some so much of that group work to sounding out things between partners.
That's harder to do on Internet platforms.

[34:25] I think they can be done well. Maybe with the profusion of
virtual reality, we can get to a place where digital classrooms will be
just as good as analog classrooms. I'd love to see that day, but I do
love the classroom. [laughs]

**Derek**:  [34:45] There's something about being in the same place at
the same time. Even the walls themselves are saying, "Hey, we're all
here for a purpose." We're not here to wander in and out, but we're here
for a time and a purpose. I think that's pretty powerful.

**Tim**:  [35:07] Absolutely.

**Derek**:  [35:07] I'm a big fan.

[35:09] [laughter]

**Derek**:  [35:09] Tim, this has been great. Thanks for chatting with
us.

**Tim**:  [35:04] Absolutely. Thank you so much for having me.

[35:07] [music]

**Derek**:  [35:08] That was Tim Foster, a doctoral student in the
Vanderbilt Department of Spanish and Portuguese.

[35:13] We're trying here in the Leading Lines podcast, to different
kinds of voices from the world of educational technology. That includes
graduate students like Tim and like Zoe LeBlanc, the history graduate
student who appeared in episode eight.

[35:25] When it comes to the future of educational technology,
something we're trying to shape through this podcast, I like to see what
our grad students are doing. They often have the freedom and the
creativity to try new things in their teaching. I'm often impressed with
how savvy they are about educational technology.

[35:40] If you want to see what Tim's students wrote for the national
entry in the Portuguese language version of Wikipedia, just search for
"National" in Wikipedia and switch your language. Or check out the show
notes where there's a direct link.

[35:51] We've also included in the show notes, a few resources for
teaching with Wikipedia. Including ones provided by the Wikimedia
Foundation and the Wiki Education Foundation. You can find those notes
on our website leadinglinespod.com. We welcome your comments and
questions there and on Twitter where our handle is @leadinglinespod.
