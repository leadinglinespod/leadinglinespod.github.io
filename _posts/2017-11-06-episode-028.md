Episode 28: Akos Ledeczi

[00:00] [background music]

**Derek Bruff**:  [00:10] Welcome to \"Leading Lines,\" a podcast from
Vanderbilt University. I\'m your host, Derek Bruff, the Director of the
Vanderbilt Center for Teaching.

[00:13] In this podcast, we explore creative, intentional, and
effective uses of technology to enhance student learning, uses that we
hope point the way to the future of educational technology in college
and university settings.

[00:25] In this episode, we talk with Akos Ledeczi, Professor of
Computer Engineering and a Senior Research Scientist at the Institute
for Software Integrated Systems here at Vanderbilt University.

[00:37] Akos is the lead developer for NetsBlox, a graphical
programming language designed to introduce novice programmers from
middle school to college to networked programming.

[00:46] Students can use NetsBlox to create simple multi‑player games
and to build apps that interface with publicly available data sets. Akos
is interviewed by Cliff Anderson, Associate University Librarian for
Research and Learning and a member of our Leading Lines team.

[01:01] Cliff and Akos discuss the past, present and future of
NetsBlox and explore how graphical programming languages like NetsBlox,
Snap and Scratch are changing computer science education.

[01:13] One terminology note, Akos uses the term blocks‑based coding
to refer to programming languages like NetsBlox and Scratch, in which
graphical interfaces allow users to drag blocks of instructions together
to create relatively complex programs.

[01:27] [background music]

**Cliff Anderson**:  [01:27] Hi, this is Cliff Anderson. I am the
Associate University Librarian for Research and Learning and Professor
of Religious Studies at Vanderbilt. I\'m here with Akos Ledeczi,
Professor of Computer Engineering, Director of Graduate Studies in
Computer Science and also Senior Research Scientist at the Institute for
Software Integrated Systems at Vanderbilt.

[01:50] Welcome, Akos.

**Akos Ledeczi**:  [01:51] Thank you.

**Cliff**:  [01:52] Today, we\'re going to be talking broadly about
the area of computational thinking, but in particular about a new tool
that Akos and his team had put together, that is called [NetsBlox](https://netsblox.org/).

[02:04] One of the things, before we get into what NetsBlox is, is to
talk about how you became interested in this area of blocks‑based
programming and model‑based computer systems.

**Akos**:  [02:18] Yes, thank you. I took a really long and roundabout
way of getting where I am right now. When I started with my graduate
studies in the early \'90s, our main research area was this model‑based
engineering or what we call model-integrated computing.

[02:35] The idea was that there was very little modeling done in
software engineering at the time and then computer science, so we tried
to bring in a more disciplined approach to creating software systems.

[02:46] The idea was to create domain‑specific modeling languages.
These are graphical modeling languages to software engineering. The
reason to do domain‑specific, and not one universal modeling language
because software is being used in all kinds of different domains and to
us, it never made sense to just try to create one modeling language to
capture all.

[03:08] In different engineering disciplines and different science
disciplines, there are all of the existing modeling formalisms, so why
not create an environment and the modeling language that fits that
domain well.

[03:22] That was our idea, and we created a series of tools where you
can actually define a modeling language also through graphical means.
This environment would configure itself to support that domain‑specific
modeling language.

[03:36] There are actually existing examples of domain‑specific design
environments already being widely used. One example would be [LabVIEW](http://www.ni.com/en-us/shop/labview.html) or
[Simulink Stateflow](https://www.mathworks.com/products/stateflow.html) from MathWorks. These are graphical languages helping
engineers create signal processing systems control algorithms or
laboratory experiments.

[03:58] Of course, if you don\'t have a big enough market, it will be
really expensive to create a tool just for a small market. Instead, we
have this generic tool that was really easy to configure to create a
modeling language, and through tool support and APIs, write code
generators.

[04:14] Part of the system would be modeled with these graphical tools
and the code would be automatically generated. We have actually many
successful applications of these techniques throughout the years.

**Cliff**:  [04:24] In a way, this connects, if I understand
correctly, with your interest in blocks‑based programming or graphical
programming. I\'m not sure which term you prefer.

**Akos**:  [04:35] That early part of my career was really based on
modeling, so we didn\'t try to model the software. We tried to model the
system, and then generate the software from there.

[04:45] When I started teaching introductory programming with MATLAB
to freshmen ‑‑ non‑major freshmen actually, non‑Computer Science majors
‑‑ I noticed that coming with zero programming background and learning
text‑based programming language was a pretty big job for many of the
students.

[05:05] That\'s when I started to introduce one of the block‑based
programming languages, [Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/), just for the first two weeks of the
semester. The students actually liked it and it helped them with the
initial learning curve, then we switched to MATLAB. That\'s how my
interest in block‑based programming grew and this model‑based approach
and the block‑based came together.

**Cliff**:  [05:31] We were talking before we got started, that
graphical‑based computing languages have actually been around for a
while now. In fact, [Logo](https://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~bh/logo.html), which was created in 1967, when paired with
[Turtle graphics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turtle_graphics), has been used for a long time as a tool to teach
computational thinking in classrooms. I remember using that in the
1980s.

[05:49] What\'s fun is that my son is now using it when he\'s reading
Gene Luen Yang\'s and Mike Holmes\' series, [Secret Coders](http://www.worldcat.org/title/secret-coders/oclc/930298871), that uses
Logo programming to teach basic computer science concepts.

[05:59] Especially fun is the fact that at the end of the book,
there\'s a program listing that he has to type in to get a secret code.
I remember doing the exact same thing in the 1980s when I\'d get
magazines.

[06:09] To learn a game, I\'d type in the code listing at the end of
the magazine and then see how it worked, which was a great way to learn
about computer programming. In any case, you mentioned Scratch. Can you
talk a little bit about how you used Scratch in that course and what you
found its limitations to be?

**Akos**:  [06:27] As I said, I started teaching [MATLAB](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and it took
us, basically, a month to get the loops and the statements, because
it\'s more complicated. The syntax is harder. I started looking for ways
of easing this transition from no background to programming. I grew
Scratch, and it was really amazing because it was so intuitive.

[06:51] It was a great way of trying to hide a syntax or not get
bogged down with the syntax, but think about the algorithms, the
computational thinking and not worry about what you have to type, why
does the compiler complain, and stuff like that. I liked Scratch, it was
really intuitive. When I started doing it, we were able to, together,
write our first program with loops and if‑statements during the very
first class.

[07:20] It didn\'t take us a month to go there. It takes us half an
hour to go through some of the most important concepts in programming.
That was really great, and my philosophy is to learn programming, you
have to do it. If you just come to a lecture and listen to what I\'m
saying, you\'re not going to learn programming.

[07:39] The first week, I assigned them a sizable project. They had to
do it in Scratch. Basically, the first week, they have to do
programming, and it turned out very well.

**Cliff**:  [07:48] Probably, there\'s fear when you\'re facing a
blank page, like any writer has, when you don\'t even know where to
start. Scratch gives you a palette and lets you drag things on and experiment. It\'s just much easier to begin.

**Akos**:  [08:02] Exactly. Now that I\'m teaching in various schools
in Nashville, not just at Vanderbilt but various middle schools and high
schools, some of the feedback I get is exactly this. \"It\'s so much
easier to do it because I can just see what\'s available and start using
it like Lego blocks, and don\'t have to start with a blank\...\"
[laughs]

[08:24] [crosstalk]

**Cliff**:  [08:24] Screen editor. If I understand correctly, your
project builds on [Snap](https://snap.berkeley.edu/), which is a variant of Scratch, that introduces
more powerful computer science constructs. Can you talk a little bit
about how Snap advances the block‑based programing paradigm from
Scratch?

**Akos**:  [08:42] I think Scratch is great. The best demographic is
elementary school and middle school. Once you get to high school, and of
course college freshmen, like I did, some of the students would consider
it too childish or too limiting and things like that. Snap is actually
great because it added some important, more advanced concepts to what
Scratch supports.

[09:11] For example, recursion or full‑fledged functions called custom
blocks and some higher order functions. There are some features of Snap
that I have never used even now.

**Cliff**:  [09:22] I see it allows you to do [continuations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation), which is
a unique feature in [Scheme](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)). It is pretty advanced.

**Akos**:  [09:29] Right. I think what they call it is a graphical
version of Scheme. That\'s exactly what they tried to do. That is great.
Of course, there was one huge advantage over Scratch, which is its open
source and it\'s implemented in Java Suite. We were able to take that
open source code base and add blocks on top of it.

**Cliff**:  [09:48] Let\'s come to NetsBlox. NetsBlox, as I
understand, it has two major innovations. One is message passing and the
other is distributive programming. Can you talk about why you added
those two features in particular as your innovations on Snap?

**Akos**:  [10:01] If you go back one decade, two decades ago I was
working with model integrated computing. A decade ago, I started working
with distributive programming, specifically wireless sensor networks. I
really like these two areas.

[10:19] When I started using Scratch and then Snap, I realized that
even though Snap is much more advanced, it\'s still limiting because it
still puts you in a sandbox, which is the stage where your photographic
objects can move around and whatnot. You are still limited to that
sandbox.

[10:38] The idea was, these days, almost any application used on your
phone or your laptop is network. You go to Google Maps. You listen to
Pandora. You go to Netflix, Facebook. Everything is networked. I thought
that was a really big missing piece from these block‑based languages to
open up the Internet. How can you do that?

[11:02] We started brainstorming with my team. They came up with these
two abstractions on this message passing so that actually you can pass
messages between two computers.

[11:15] Our goal was to enable multi‑player games. Kids play
multi‑player games all the time. How about making it easy for them to
create multi‑player games? That should spike their interest. That was
one reason we introduced message passing.

[11:30] The other main concept we introduced, what we call remote
procedure calls which allows you to call some kind of function, some
kind of procedure in the remote machine. That remote machine, in our
case, is our own server.

[11:44] There, we interfaced to a set of public domain databases or
data sources on the Internet such as Google Maps, Weather, USGS Earth
Screen Data, or the Sloan Digital SkyServer for Astrodome Images to open
movie database and a bunch of others. Now, kids can write programs which
can access these data sources.

[12:09] For example, in a five‑minute video, I show how you can create
an interactive weather map where you have the entire world show up as a
Google Map background. You can click anywhere. It shows you the current
conditions anywhere on the world. It literally takes five minutes to
create that application with NetsBlox.

**Cliff**:  [12:29] I think it\'s wonderful, especially that you
provided so many different examples so that people can get started, see
how the code works and then see what the code is exactly, what the
blocks are and then take it from there.

**Akos**:  [12:37] Right. The whole thing is obviously iterative in
the sense that these kinds of applications, these network applications
that get data from the server start out easy just like this weather
application. Of course, you can get more and more complicated when you
get to the message passing.

[12:52] Again, you can do some relatively simple applications like
implement a quick chat room, or text messages, or something like that.
Once you get to the multi‑player games, now that\'s a relatively big
jump because now you have to think about distributed algorithms.

[13:06] It\'s much more complicated than just a simple algorithm. Now
two machines running in parallel has to coordinate and communicate with
each other. That\'s where the ceiling is raised for learning more
advanced concepts.

**Cliff**:  [13:24] Yeah, I would say that a large majority of
computer programmers in the professional world have difficulty with
those concepts.

**Akos**:  [13:30] Right. Except, NetsBlox makes them a whole lot
simpler than you would have to do it in Java or anything else. These are
the kinds of games we support, more like either board games or games
where there is some limited amount of animation.

[13:48] Of course, you know the name of the first‑person shooter game.
That\'s only because it\'s just not what it was designed for.

**Cliff**:  [13:55] Another area that\'s caught the attention of the
educational technology community are microcontrollers. I know there have
been people developing blocks‑based programming languages for
controllers like the [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc/). For example, [ArduBlock](https://github.com/taweili/ardublock), [mBlock](http://www.mblock.cc/), or [S4A](http://s4a.cat/).
Have you thought about developing a version of NetsBlox to use on the
Arduino?

**Akos**:  [14:15] Yes, definitely. Actually, there is a version of
Snap called [Snap4Arduino](http://snap4arduino.rocks/). The developer of that version and the Snap
developers are working relatively closely. By the way, we are also
working with that same team closely because they like what we are doing.
Yes, definitely, that\'s an interesting topic.

[14:38] What we actually would like to do is even better, which is we
want to introduce robotics. There are of course all of the existing
robots that you can program with these block‑based languages.

[14:48] What NetsBlox can bring to the table is using multi‑player
blocks. Now, the robots can communicate with each other. You can
implement the robot team‑based applications, not just programming the
same robots.

**Cliff**:  [15:07] Boy, that sounds fantastic, great plan.

**Akos**:  [15:10] Yes. That\'s our next plan.

**Cliff**:  [15:13] Well, I guess you\'re just leading me into my next
question, which is where do you plan to go next with NetsBlox? I know
you\'ve received some grant funding at this point, but I also get the
sense that this is just the beginning for you. Can you talk about some
of your plans for the future apart from robotics?

**Akos**:  [15:28] Yes, that\'s right. First of all, I\'d like to
thank the [TIPs program](https://www.vanderbilt.edu/strategicplan/trans-institutional-programs/tipshome.php) of Vanderbilt that kickstarted the whole thing.
Once we had that going and we had an early prototype, we were able to
convince the National Science Foundation to give us some more funding to
develop NetsBlox into a full‑fledged environment. Yes, robotics is
definitely one area we would like to look into.

[15:49] The other one is porting NetsBlox applications to iPhones and
Android phones and then give access to the sensors there. Now, the
students will be able to write the applications that use the motion
sensor [inaudible] made or camera even on the phone. That will be
another interesting extension.

[16:11] Another probably longer term is creating a more advanced
version of NetsBlox that, instead of a visual programming language, uses
Python. Again, the networking part is still fairly problematic. It\'s
only taught in computer science in college‑level classes and not even
freshmen college level of classes. Probably junior level.

[16:37] What if we could have a Python‑based environment that exposes
high school students to networking so the more advanced students who
find the block‑based approach limiting, still they could actually
graduate to Python and still use these data sources and the message
passing abstractions so that they can write this to the applications.

**Cliff**:  [16:59] That actually leads me to another question. You
mentioned that there are limitations to block‑based programming
languages and that to accomplish certain tasks, you have to step outside
of them to text‑based languages, say Python, in order to get things
done.

[17:12] Could you foresee a future in which, for a certain subclass of
students, block‑based paradigms meet all their computing needs so that
they could stay entirely within a block‑based language and still get
significant computational tasks accomplished?

**Akos**:  [17:28] I think that maybe it will bring together that
whole model‑based idea that I was talking about at the beginning and the
block‑based programming. I can certainly see a domain‑specific
environment that are not necessarily a general‑purpose programming
language.

[17:47] These kinds of languages, you can write small programs, few
hundred blocks, maybe 1,000 blocks. Beyond that, it becomes
unmanageable. Just like today, for example, I teach MATLAB, as I
mentioned.

[17:59] That\'s a full‑fetched programming language and it\'s
text‑based programming language, yet it\'s not the general purpose, in
the sense that nobody\'s writing operating systems or word processors in
MATLAB. That\'s for very specific, scientific computing, numerical
computing, sigma processing, and those kinds of applications, and it\'s
great. You can write a few thousand‑line codes in MATLAB.

[18:19] It\'s really a wonderful tool, but it\'s not a general purpose
programming language, so I can imagine these domain‑specific
environments that will speak to block‑based programming because it\'s
simply easier to learn.

[18:34] If your main job is not to write programs, but to do something
else, work in the sciences or whatnot, and you find it difficult to
learn a general purpose programming language, these domain‑specific
environments specifically tailored for your domain could be way of the
future.

**Cliff**:  [18:50] I guess you might look at a product like [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com/),
for example, which allows you to do data visualization with a wonderful
palette of features, and doesn\'t require you to step into programming
languages, like R or Python, when all you want to do is output an
interactive visualization.

[19:05] I could imagine that there\'d be tools like that in other
domains that will allow you to stay within a block‑based language, and
to get your work done. There are also tools like Blockly from Google,
for example, that allow you to program in a visual style, and then
output textual programs in standard languages like JavaScript.

[19:23] Do you see a role for outputting textual programs from
NetsBlox in a similar manner?

**Akos**:  [19:28] I see [Blockly](https://developers.google.com/blockly/) as somewhat different than the block
Snap Extension and NetsBlox is trying to do. Blockly is more for people
who want to create tools like NetsBlox, so we could have used Blockly
instead of Snap, but Snap was much closer to what we wanted.

[19:51] Actually, in one of our projects that we created, a molecular
dynamic simulation front‑end tool for chemical engineers, and one of the
aspects of that tool was based on Blockly, so they could drive this
simulation script in a Blockly‑based visual programming language. I
think for those kinds of things, Blockly is great.

[20:14] For what we\'re trying to do, I think Snap was much better as
a starting point.

**Cliff**:  [20:21] Let\'s come back around to this theme of
computational thinking, because if we\'re seeing greater adoption of
these tools in the K‑12 arena, how do you think that\'ll affect students
coming into Vanderbilt?

[20:35] I think one of the things that you and I have talked about in
other contexts is the unevenness of people\'s background in
computational thinking, and in experiential programming languages when
they arrive on campus, and how that maybe shapes their trajectories
here. Can you talk a little bit about what you\'d like to see?

[20:50] You mentioned you\'re volunteering in middle schools, I think,
or elementary schools. How will this shape the students that we\'re
going to see, do you think?

**Akos**:  [20:59] That\'s a great question. There is actually a
nationwide movement to introduce more computer science into all kinds of
schools, and I think that\'s great. It\'s great, not because we want
everybody to become a computer science major, but basically, most kinds
of job these days, be in sciences, STEM, or even humanities, or anywhere
else.

[21:26] A lot of those jobs require some basic knowledge of
programming. That\'s definitely an important consideration. On the other
hand, these text‑based languages still act as a barrier, in the sense
that many kids find it really scary to even take a class that\'s based
on computer science and whatnot.

[21:53] I think one other big advantage of this block‑based language
is that they lower the barrier and make it more appealing to students,
who would otherwise not consider computer science or even just taking a
computing course, in general.

**Cliff**:  [22:12] As we wind up, we always ask our guests, because
this is an educational podcast, what\'s their favorite analog
educational technology?

**Akos**:  [22:21] [laughs] Analog educational technology, never
heard that expression in my life.

[22:28] [laughter]

**Akos**:  [22:30] I was closer in saying drawing in general, but
yeah, it\'s a tool. The calendar, [laughs] [inaudible] , it\'s
probably still\...

**Cliff**:  [22:36] If we did a poll, that would be way out on top.
Thank you, Akos. This has been terrific, and we really appreciate your
time.

[22:49] [background music]

**Akos**:  [22:49] Thank you so much for having me.

**Derek**:  [22:50] That was Akos Ledeczi, Professor of Computer
Engineering, here at Vanderbilt University, and Lead Developer of the
graphical network programming language, NetsBlox. See the show notes for
more information on NetsBlox, including information on how to get
started using it.

[23:01] I\'m really interested in one of the questions Cliff asked
near the end of the interview about the growing emphasis on computer
programming in K‑12 settings.

[23:08] My younger daughter started learning to code in Scratch last
year, in third grade, and she\'s really loving her After‑School Robotics
Club this year, in fourth grade.

[23:16] Now, she\'s choosing for more programming experiences by doing
this afterschool stuff, but I know that Scratch is a standard part of
the curriculum at her elementary school, and in others as well.

[23:26] I keep trying to imagine what she\'ll know about coding, as a
college freshman eight years from now, compared to what I knew at the
end of my college career, as a computer science major.

[23:36] With more and more programming experiences in K12 settings,
it\'s likely that students will arrive on our campuses in the coming
years with some, perhaps, significant skills in computer programming.

[23:46] How might that change the computer science curriculum? How
might that change the curriculum in other disciplines? I\'d love to hear
your thoughts on these questions.

[23:53] You can find this on Twitter @leadinglinespod, and we\'re
going to try this for the first time. You can send us a voicemail via
email to leadinglinespod@vanderbilt.edu. I\'d love to hear your thoughts
on how a K12 programming experiences might change the curriculum at the
college level.
